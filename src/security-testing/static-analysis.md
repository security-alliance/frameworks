# Static Analysis

Static analysis is when we look at our code or have some tool look at our code without actually executing it. Unlike dynamic testing (unit tests, fuzz tests, integration tests), static analysis examines your code's structure, syntax, and patterns to identify potential vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

Think of static analysis as having an automated code reviewer that never gets tired and knows every common vulnerability pattern.

## What is Static Analysis?

Static analysis tools parse your source code and analyze it against known vulnerability patterns, coding standards, and best practices. They can quickly identify issues like:

- **Known vulnerability patterns** (reentrancy, integer overflow, etc.)
- **Code quality issues** (unused variables, dead code)
- **Style violations** (naming conventions, formatting)
- **Logic errors** (unreachable code, incorrect assertions)

For example, this code has a classic reentrancy vulnerability:

```solidity
contract VulnerableContract {
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function withdraw() public {
        uint256 amount = balances[msg.sender];
        (bool success,) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "Transfer failed");
        balances[msg.sender] = 0; // ‚ùå State update after external call
    }
}
```

A static analysis tool will automatically detect this reentrancy pattern and flag it as a high-severity issue.
