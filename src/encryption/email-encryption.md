# Email Encryption
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist]

Email is insecure and un-encrypted by default, but can become more secure by following best practices:

## Best Practices

1. **Implement S/MIME or PGP**: 
   - **S/MIME**: Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) is a widely accepted protocol for sending digitally signed and encrypted messages. It requires a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Popular email clients like Microsoft Outlook and Apple Mail support S/MIME.
     - **Example**:
       1. Obtain an S/MIME certificate from a trusted CA (e.g., Comodo, Symantec).
       2. Install the certificate in your email client:
          - **Outlook**: Go to `File` > `Options` > `Trust Center` > `Trust Center Settings` > `Email Security` > `Import/Export` to import your certificate.
          - **Apple Mail**: Open `Mail` > `Preferences` > `Accounts` > `Advanced` > `Certificates` to add your certificate.
       3. Compose a new email and select the option to sign/encrypt the email.
   - **PGP**: Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is another method for encrypting emails. It uses a decentralized trust model and is supported by tools like GnuPG (GPG), which is an open-source implementation. Extensions like Enigmail for Thunderbird or FlowCrypt for Gmail can simplify the process.
     - **Example**:
       1. Install GnuPG (GPG) on your system.
       2. Generate a key pair using the command: `gpg --gen-key`.
       3. Share your public key with your contacts.
       4. Install an email client extension:
          - **Thunderbird**: Install Enigmail from the Thunderbird add-on store.
          - **Gmail**: Install FlowCrypt from the Chrome Web Store.
       5. Configure the extension with your GPG key.
       6. Compose a new email and use the extension to encrypt/sign the email.

2. **Train Project Members**: Conduct regular training sessions to ensure all team members understand how to use email encryption tools effectively. Provide step-by-step guides and resources for troubleshooting common issues.

3. **Use Trusted Email Gateways**: Ensure that your email service provider uses secure and trusted gateways to protect both incoming and outgoing communications. Verify that the provider complies with industry standards and regulations.

4. **Transmit Emails Over TLS**: Ensure that all emails are transmitted over TLS-encrypted connections. This can be configured in your email server settings. TLS (Transport Layer Security) helps protect the data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering.

5. **Open Source Alternatives**:
   - **GnuPG (GPG)**: An open-source implementation of PGP, widely used for encrypting and signing data and communications.
   - **Mailvelope**: A browser extension that integrates PGP encryption into web-mail services like Gmail, Outlook, and Yahoo Mail.
   - **ProtonMail**: A secure email service that offers end-to-end encryption and is open-source. It provides an easy-to-use interface and strong privacy protections.

By following these best practices and utilizing the recommended tools, you can significantly enhance the security of your email communications.
