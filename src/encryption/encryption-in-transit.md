# Encryption in Transit
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist]

Encryption in transit means how data is being encrypted while it flows across networks. This is important as you don't want anyone eavesdropping on your traffic, and by following best practices such as the ones below, you can reduce the risk of that:

## Best Practices

1. Ensure that all data transmitted over the internet is encrypted using TLS/SSL.
2. Use secure VPNs to encrypt data transmitted over public networks such as public WiFi.
3. Use SSH for secure remote access to servers and other infrastructure.
4. Use encryption protocols such as S/MIME or PGP for email communications.
