## For Intermediates & Medium Balances

### User Profile

An intermediate user who is comfortable with web3 interactions and is now managing a significant, but not life-altering, amount of assets. This user understands the inherent risks of hot wallets and is actively seeking to upgrade their security posture to protect their capital.

### Primary Goal

The main objective is to secure balances against online threats while still retaining the ability to interact with dApps when necessary. This involves **separating the bulk of assets** from daily operational balances.

### Recommended Setup

A **hardware wallet** is the core of this setup. This dedicated physical device stores private keys offline in a secure, tamper-resistant environment, acting as a vault for the majority of the user's balances.

### Key Considerations & Trade-offs

Adopting a hardware wallet introduces a new set of security considerations focused on physical and supply chain vectors.

* **Physical Security:** A hardware wallet is a physical asset that must be protected from theft, damage, or coercion.
* **Supply Chain Integrity:** Hardware wallets must *only* be purchased directly from the manufacturer or an authorized reseller to avoid receiving a tampered device.
* **Convenience vs. Security:** Using a hardware wallet introduces friction into the transaction process, as it requires physical access and approval on the device for every signature.

### How to Select a Hardware Wallet

* **Open Source:** Evaluate if the wallet's firmware and software are open-source, which allows for public auditing and verification by the security community.
* **Secure Element (SE)** Look for devices with a SE certified, tamper-resistant chip that protects against physical attacks. Check for high assurance ratings like `EAL6+` and features like **attestation**, which verifies the device is genuine.
* **Reputation & Incident:** Investigate the manufacturer's security track record, including their response to past vulnerabilities, data breaches, and overall transparency.
* **Verify Device Integrity**: A legitimate hardware wallet will arrive uninitialized, requiring you to perform the initial setup. Reject any device that comes with a pre-set PIN, a pre-generated recovery phrase, or appears to be already configured, as it is likely compromised.
