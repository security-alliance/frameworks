## Private Key & Seed Phrase Management

The **seed phrase** (or mnemonic phrase) is the master key to a non-custodial wallet, granting complete control over all its derived **private keys** and assets. The management of this phrase is the single most important aspect of self-custody security.

> ⚠️ If you suspect for even a moment that your private key or seed phrase has been lost, viewed by another person, or exposed digitally (e.g., shown on-screen, copied to a clipboard on a connected device), you must **consider it compromised.** Immediately create a new, secure wallet and transfer all assets to it.


### Secure Storage Practices


The goal is to protect the seed phrase from both physical threats (theft, fire, water damage) and digital threats (hacking, malware).

- **Offline is the Standard**: The default state for your seed phrase must be offline. It should never be typed, stored, or transmitted on any device with an internet connection.

- **Back Up Immediately**: As soon as a new wallet is created, back up the seed phrase using a secure offline method. Wallet providers do not have access to your seed phrase and cannot help you recover it.

- **Physical Written Copies**: Writing the phrase on paper is a valid method, but it must be stored securely in multiple, geographically separate locations (e.g., a personal safe, a bank deposit box) to mitigate risk of loss or damage.



### Prohibited Practices

Under no circumstances should you ever store your seed phrase in any of the following ways:

- Taking a digital photograph of it.
- Uploading it to cloud storage (iCloud, Google Drive, Dropbox).
- Sending it via text message or any messaging app.
- Sending it in an email, even to yourself.
- Storing it in a plain text file on a computer or phone.
- Sharing it with anyone. Wallet providers will **never** ask for your seed phrase.
- Never use a device obtained from an untrusted source, such as a conference, hackathon, or third-party online marketplace, as it may be tampered with.

### Ongoing Security Hygiene

**1. Periodic Security Audits**

On a recurring basis (e.g., every 6 months), conduct a security review by asking:

- Do I know the physical location of all my seed phrase backups?
- Are my storage methods still secure and uncompromised?
- If my primary device were destroyed, do I have a clear plan to recover my assets?

**2. Key Rotation**

While you can use the same keys for years, it is a best practice to periodically rotate them by moving assets to new wallets.

**3. Succession Planning**

Establish a clear, secure protocol for a trusted next-of-kin to access your assets in case of incapacitation or death. This may involve sealed instructions stored with a lawyer or in a safe deposit box.
