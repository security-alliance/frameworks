# Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets

## Custodial Wallets

### What Are They?
Custodial wallets are managed by a third party, such as an exchange or a wallet service provider. The third party holds and manages the private keys on behalf of the user.

### Characteristics
- **Managed Private Keys**: The third party has control over the private keys.
- **Recovery Options**: Easier to recover access if credentials are lost, as the third party can assist.
- **Security Dependence**: Security depends on the third party's practices and infrastructure.

### Use Cases
- **New Users**: Suitable for users who are new to cryptocurrency and prefer a simpler, managed solution.
- **Convenience**: Ideal for users who prioritize convenience and ease of use over full control.

## Non-Custodial Wallets

### What Are They?
Non-custodial wallets are managed by the user, who has full control over their private keys. The user is responsible for the security and management of their keys.

### Characteristics
- **User-Controlled Private Keys**: The user has full control over their private keys.
- **Higher Security**: Greater security and privacy, as only the user has access to the keys.
- **Responsibility**: The user is solely responsible for backing up and securing their keys.

### Use Cases
- **Experienced Users**: Suitable for users who have a good understanding of cryptocurrency and wallet security.
- **Security Prioritization**: Ideal for users who prioritize security and control over convenience.
