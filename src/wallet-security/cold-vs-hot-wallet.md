# Cold vs. Hot Wallets


## Cold Wallets

### What Are They?
Cold wallets are offline storage solutions for cryptocurrencies. They are not connected to the internet, which makes them highly secure against online attacks.

### Types of Cold Wallets
- **Hardware Wallets**: Physical devices that store private keys offline.
- **Paper Wallets**: Physical printouts or handwritten notes of private keys and QR codes.
- **Air-Gapped Computers**: Computers that are never connected to the internet.

### Use Cases
- **Long-Term Storage**: Ideal for storing large amounts of cryptocurrency for extended periods.
- **High Security Needs**: Suitable for users who prioritize security over convenience.

## Hot Wallets

### What Are They?
Hot wallets are online storage solutions for cryptocurrencies. They are connected to the internet, making them more convenient but less secure than cold wallets.

### Types of Hot Wallets
- **Mobile Wallets**: Apps installed on smartphones.
- **Desktop Wallets**: Software installed on computers.
- **Web Wallets**: Online services accessible via web browsers.

### Use Cases
- **Daily Transactions**: Ideal for users who need quick access to their funds for transactions.
- **Small Balances**: Suitable for storing smaller amounts of cryptocurrency that are used regularly.
