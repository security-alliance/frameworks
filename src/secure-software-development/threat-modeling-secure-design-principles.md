# Threat Modeling and Secure Design Principles

Threat modeling and secure design principles help identify and mitigating potential security threats during the design phase of software development. T

## Threat Modeling

1. **Identify Assets**
   - Determine the valuable assets that need protection, such as user funds, sensitive data, user credentials, and intellectual property.

2. **Identify Threats**
   - Identify potential threats to the assets using models like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege).

3. **Assess Risks**
   - Evaluate the risks associated with each identified threat based on its likelihood and potential impact.

4. **Develop Mitigations**
   - Design and implement security controls to mitigate the identified threats. Prioritize mitigations based on the assessed risks.

5. **Validate and Iterate**
   - Regularly validate the threat model and update it as the application evolves. Continuously assess and improve security measures.

## Secure Design Principles

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Grant users and systems the minimum level of access necessary to perform their functions. Reduce the attack surface by limiting permissions.

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Implement multiple layers of security controls to protect against different types of threats. Ensure that security is not reliant on a single control.

3. **Fail Securely**
   - Design systems to fail in a secure manner. Ensure that errors and failures do not expose sensitive information or create security vulnerabilities.

4. **Secure Defaults**
   - Configure systems with secure default settings. Require users to opt into less secure configurations rather than opting into secure ones.

5. **Separation of Duties**
   - Separate critical functions to prevent a single individual or system from having excessive control. Implement checks and balances.

6. **Secure by Design**
   - Integrate security into the design and architecture of the application. Consider security implications during every stage of the design process.
