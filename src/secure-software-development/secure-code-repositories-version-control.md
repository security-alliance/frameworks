# Secure Code Repositories and Version Control
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist, Devops]

Managing secure code repositories and having version control practices helps protect your project from unauthorized access and ensuring the integrity of your project.

## Best Practices for Secure Code Repositories

1. **Access Control**
   - Implement strict access controls to limit who can view, modify, and commit code.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to grant permissions based on the user's role within the organization.

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
   - Require MFA for all users accessing the code repository to add an extra layer of security.
   - Use hardware tokens or authentication apps for stronger security.

3. **Branch Protection**
   - Enable branch protection rules to prevent unauthorized changes to critical branches such as main/master.
   - Require code reviews and approvals by another person before changes can be merged into the main/master branch.

4. **Audit Logs**
   - Enable audit logging to track all activities within the repository.
   - Regularly review logs to detect any suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

## Secure Version Control Practices

1. **Commit Signing**
   - Require developers to sign their commits with GPG keys to verify the authenticity of the code changes.
   - Enforce commit signing policies in the version control system.

2. **Regular Backups**
   - Regularly back up the code repository to prevent data loss.
   - Store backups in a secure, offsite location.

3. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**
   - Integrate security checks into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that only tested and approved code is deployed to production.
