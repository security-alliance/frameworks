# Bug Bounties

tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist]

Bug bounty programs incentivize security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in your project. They augments a security team and audits by allowing external security researchers to disclose vulnerabilities in your project in a way that should be a good experience for the security researcher. Depending what the scope of the bug bounty program is, you may have a higher success rate having certain parts at different types of bug bounty as a service providers, as they generally have security researchers with different skill sets using their platforms.
