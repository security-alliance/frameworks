# Operational Security

Operational security, often abbreviated as **OpSec** provides a range of practices and measures designed to safeguard an organization's sensitive information, assets, and operations from unauthorized access, espionage, disruption, or compromise.

Operational security is not just a concern for large corporations or government agencies; it is relevant to any project that handles sensitive information, including personal data or digital assets. The consequences of failing to implement robust OpSec measures can be severe, ranging from financial losses to reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

The level of Operational Security to apply will differ greatly depending on the risk appetite the team is willing to accept.
