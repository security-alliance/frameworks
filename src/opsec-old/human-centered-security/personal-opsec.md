# Personal OpSec for Team Members

Personal operational security (OpSec) extends beyond the workplace, encompassing practices that team members should implement in their personal lives to protect both themselves and organizational assets. This is particularly important in Web3 where the boundaries between personal and professional digital presence are often blurred.

## Digital Footprint Management

### Social Media Practices

1. Regularly audit and adjust privacy settings on all social media platforms
2. Be cautious about revealing employment details, especially for high-profile or security-sensitive roles
3. Avoid sharing location data in real-time, particularly during travel
4. Consider using separate accounts for professional and personal interactions
5. Be mindful of information revealed in photos, including backgrounds that might expose sensitive information

### Public Information Minimization

1. Periodically search for your own name and digital identifiers to understand your public exposure
2. Request removal of sensitive personal information from data broker sites
3. Use domain privacy services if you own personal domains
4. Consider using pseudonyms for non-professional online activities where appropriate and legal

## Personal Device Security

### Home Network Security

1. Secure home Wi-Fi networks with strong passwords and WPA3 encryption when available
2. Segment networks to separate IoT devices from computers used for work
3. Keep router firmware updated and change default administrative credentials
4. Consider using a dedicated VLAN for work activities conducted from home

### Personal Device Hardening

1. Apply the same security standards to personal devices used for work as corporate devices
2. Implement automatic updates for operating systems and applications
3. Use password managers to maintain strong, unique passwords across services
4. Enable full-disk encryption on all personal devices
5. Install and maintain reputable security software

## Secure Communication Practices

1. Use end-to-end encrypted messaging platforms for sensitive communications
2. Be aware of metadata exposure even when content is encrypted
3. Verify security of communication channels before discussing sensitive topics
4. Consider using separate phone numbers or identifiers for high-security communications
5. Apply appropriate security measures to personal email accounts, including MFA

## Physical Security Awareness

1. Be conscious of physical surroundings when accessing sensitive information
2. Secure physical documents and devices at home, especially when traveling
3. Consider appropriate home security measures based on role sensitivity
4. Practice good physical security habits like using privacy screens in public places

## Web3-Specific Personal OpSec

### Cryptocurrency Security

1. Separate personal and work-related wallets and accounts
2. Apply strong security practices to personal crypto holdings
3. Be cautious about revealing personal cryptocurrency holdings or involvement in projects
4. Consider the implications of blockchain transparency and on-chain activity linkability
5. Use hardware wallets for long-term storage of significant personal assets

### Identity Separation

1. Consider separating on-chain identities used for work from personal activities
2. Be aware of how personal ENS names or identifiers may link to work-related activities
3. Understand the risks of doxing in the Web3 space and take appropriate precautions

## Personal Threat Modeling

1. Assess personal risk based on role, project visibility, and asset access
2. Identify potential adversaries and their capabilities
3. Implement security measures proportionate to identified risks
4. Periodically reassess as role or external factors change

## Balance and Sustainability

1. Focus on high-impact security practices that are sustainable long-term
2. Recognize that perfect security is impossible and aim for reasonable protections
3. Develop habits that incorporate security into daily routines
4. Understand the trade-offs between convenience and security in personal life

## Reporting and Support

1. Know how to report suspicious activities that might target you personally due to your role
2. Understand what organizational support is available for personal security incidents
3. Maintain awareness of current threats targeting individuals in your industry or role

By implementing personal OpSec practices, team members can significantly reduce security risks that originate outside the workplace while maintaining a reasonable balance between security and quality of life.
