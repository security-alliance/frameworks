# Create and Maintain Threat Models
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist]

Creating and maintaining threat models help identify potential security risks and develop mitigation strategies to protect the project.

## Steps to Create a Threat Model

1. **Define the Scope**
   - Identify the contract, system, application, or component to be analyzed.
   - Determine the boundaries and interfaces of the it.

2. **Identify Assets**
   - List all critical assets that need protection, such as funds, data, credentials, and infrastructure components.
   - Prioritize assets based on their importance and sensitivity.

3. **Identify Threats**
   - Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) to identify potential threats.
   - Consider various attack vectors and threat actors that could target the system.

4. **Identify Vulnerabilities**
   - Analyze the system for potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by threats.
   - Use vulnerability databases, past incident reports, and security assessments to identify common weaknesses.

5. **Create Attack Scenarios**
   - Develop detailed attack scenarios that describe how threats could exploit vulnerabilities to compromise assets.
   - Use diagrams and flowcharts to visualize the attack paths.

6. **Evaluate and Prioritize Risks**
   - Assess the likelihood and impact of each identified threat.
   - Prioritize risks based on their potential impact on the system and organization.

7. **Develop Mitigation Strategies**
   - Identify and implement controls to mitigate the identified risks.
   - Consider technical, administrative, and physical controls to reduce the risk.

8. **Document the Threat Model**
   - Create detailed documentation of the threat model, including all identified threats, vulnerabilities, attack scenarios, and mitigation strategies.
   - Use templates and standardized formats to ensure consistency.

## Maintaining Threat Models

1. **Regular Updates**
   - Update the threat model regularly to reflect changes in the system, new threats, and emerging vulnerabilities.
   - Schedule periodic reviews to ensure the model remains current.

2. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Implement continuous monitoring to detect changes in the threat landscape and system environment.
   - Use automated tools to monitor for new vulnerabilities and threats.

3. **Collaboration**
   - Foster collaboration between development, security, and operations teams to keep the threat model up to date.
   - Encourage feedback and contributions from all stakeholders.

4. **Training and Awareness**
   - Provide training for team members on threat modeling concepts and techniques.
   - Raise awareness about the importance of threat modeling in maintaining security.

## Tools for Threat Modeling

1. **Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool**
   - A free tool that helps create threat models using the STRIDE framework.
   - Pros: Easy to use, integrates with Microsoft technologies.
   - Cons: Limited to Windows platforms.

2. **OWASP Threat Dragon**
   - An open-source threat modeling tool for creating diagrams and identifying threats.
   - Pros: Free, web-based, supports multiple platforms.
   - Cons: Limited features compared to commercial tools.
