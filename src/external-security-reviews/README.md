# External Security Reviews


External security reviews are quite common in web3 when it comes to smart contract audits which are often being done to check if the smart contracts are secure.

It's important to note though that smart contracts are not the only components that should be considered during security reviews. Any relevant off-chain software (Bridges, Oracles, Sequencers, etc.) should also be reviewed in conjunction with any on-chain application.

While external security reviews are good, they are certainly not foolproof and cannot guarantee absolute security, and for that reason this type of security testing is not a one-time event but an ongoing commitment to the safety and security of your web3 project.
