# External Security Reviews

A smart contract security audit is a time-boxed, security-based code review of a smart contract or protocol to enhance security and identify vulnerabilities. External security reviews are essential for web3 projects to protect against exploits and build trust with users and the community.

## Why Are External Security Reviews Important?

According to research, significant value has been stolen from smart contracts due to vulnerabilities. The immutable nature of blockchain means that once a smart contract is deployed, it cannot be changed without proper upgrade mechanisms. The blockchain operates in an adversarial environment where protocols must be prepared for malicious actors.

Beyond preventing hacks, external security reviews provide several key benefits:

- **Enhanced Security**: Find and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited
- **Team Education**: Level up your engineering team's knowledge through security best practices
- **Trust Building**: Demonstrate maturity and safety to users and the community
- **Risk Mitigation**: Identify business logic issues and implementation flaws

## Scope of External Security Reviews

While smart contract audits are common in web3, security reviews should encompass:

- **Smart Contracts**: Core protocol logic, token contracts, governance mechanisms
- **Off-chain Components**: Bridges, oracles, sequencers, APIs, and backend services
- **Infrastructure**: Deployment scripts, access controls, and operational procedures
- **Documentation**: Technical specifications, user guides, and security policies

External security reviews are not foolproof and cannot guarantee absolute security. They represent an ongoing commitment to safety rather than a one-time event.
