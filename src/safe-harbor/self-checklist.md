# Checklist To See if Safe Harbor is Right for You

Is your protocol ready for a crisis? Use this checklist to evaluate whether adopting the **SEAL Safe Harbor Agreement** makes sense for your protocol.

## ‚ùì Do You Need Safe Harbor?

- [ ]  **Could your protocol be exploited on-chain?**
    
    Does your protocol have user funds in smart contracts? If yes, you‚Äôre a target.
    
- [ ]  **Do you want to enable whitehats to intervene during active exploits?**
    
    If something goes wrong, would you want trusted whitehats to legally rescue funds?
    
- [ ]  **Do you already have a bug bounty or security disclosure program?**
    
    Safe Harbor complements this by covering **live attacks**. But having an existing Bug Bounty program is highly encouraged.
    
- [ ]  **Do you want to reduce risk for your users and treasury?**
    
    Protocols with Safe Harbor increase the odds of recovering funds *without* legal ambiguity.
    

If you checked any of the above - Safe Harbor is probably right for you.

## üéØ What Does Adoption Involve?

1. Define your scope (what‚Äôs covered, where funds go, bounty %, etc.)
2. (If DAO) Pass a governance proposal
3. Register on-chain
4. Update your Terms of Service and documentation
5. Make a public announcement to inform users and whitehats

It‚Äôs fast (<1 hour), flexible (DAO or non-DAO).
