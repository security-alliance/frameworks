üëã Hello! We have reason to believe your computer is compromised. Your assets & accounts are at risk.

Stop Reading Unless Your Device is Powered Off  
If your computer is still connected to the internet, turn off the Wi-Fi or unplug your Ethernet cable, and shut the device down immediately.

 Do not continue reading this document until you have done so.

If you need additional help, feel free to message SEAL-911 on Telegram at any time. But, seriously, don‚Äôt even look below this line until your computer is off.

Use a clean mobile device (phone/tablet) to read and follow this guide. You‚Äôre likely still being watched until your compromised device is offline.

Secure your remaining crypto assets. Create a new, secure wallet. Using your phone or iPad, create a brand new wallet. Back up the seed phrase by writing it down on 2 pieces of paper. Transfer any crypto out of wallets, secret recovery phrases, or private keys that were on your computer. Prioritize:

- Begin with the highest value assets and accounts you most frequently access.  
- Start with assets that are in your MetaMask, Exodus, Atomic, Rabby, Frame, or similar wallets.  
- Always move tokens, NFTs, DeFi positions before the native asset (like ETH). You need the ETH to pay for the gas to move the tokens/NFTs.  

Then move on to wallets where the seed phrase was possibly stored on your computer, saved to Apple Notes, or backed up in your password manager or another cloud storage provider.

Always remember: Do **NOT** create new wallets or passwords via the compromised device! If you need information from your compromised device to be able to do this, keep it disconnected from the internet! If you connect to the internet, the hackers will be able to see what you are doing, exfiltrate more secrets from your device, and take over more of your accounts.

Secure your protocol, admin keys, and/or company. These guys generally want to steal:

- Crypto  
- Your Telegram account  
- Your Twitter account  

However, they will not empty your wallets (or even reveal their presence) if they have reason to believe you have access to more crypto somewhere. For example, if you have critical access/control over a protocol, bridge, or centralized exchange. They will wait patiently until you log into your CEX accounts, connect your Ledger, access your company‚Äôs servers via SSH, or use your admin key to update your protocol.

Then, they will craft a custom solution just for you. For example, if you are only one signer on a multisig, they will attempt to compromise the other signers. If your protocol doesn‚Äôt have an obvious backdoor that your admin key controls, they will research and understand how they can make money anyways (e.g., via infinite mint).

Needless to say: if you have access, control, or manage other people‚Äôs money you should take these incidents very, VERY seriously. Do whatever necessary to ensure that you are not putting your company, team members, or users at risk.

Change your passwords. For each of the below items you need to:

1. Remove any and all active sessions besides the current session.  
2. Change the password to a strong, unique password using your phone or iPad.  
3. Turn on MFA via Google Authenticator (with Cloud Sync turned OFF) and/or YubiKey.  
4. Remove any recovery email addresses or phone numbers.  
5. Remove any 2FA via SMS or Email.

Prioritize the following:

1. Password Manager  
2. Telegram  
3. Twitter (Sessions, PW)  
4. Business/company logins  
5. Centralized Exchanges  
6. Google  
7. Apple/iCloud  
8. Bank accounts / saved credit/debit card information  
9. Discord, other social media websites  

**Telegram-specific Action Items:**

- Turn on 2FA:  
  - Go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Two-Step Verification  
  - Select a password and recovery email (and save it in your password manager)  

- Hide your phone number:  
  - Go to Settings > Privacy and Security > Phone Number  
  - Under ‚ÄúWho can see my phone number‚Äù, select ‚ÄúNobody‚Äù  
  - Under ‚ÄúWho can find me by my number‚Äù, select ‚ÄúMy contacts‚Äù  

If you store 2FA codes on a compromised device, you will need to use a safe device to change the 2FA codes for any accounts where they are being used.

Inform your employer + close contacts that your accounts have been compromised. The attackers are likely to try and target your close contacts, especially if your social media accounts (Telegram, Twitter) have been compromised. Reach out to any close contacts, particularly those associated with the crypto industry, to warn them that you have been compromised and to be aware if they receive any suspicious looking messages from accounts purporting to be you.

Inform your place of work about the compromise as soon as possible, especially if the compromised device is one used to access work-related systems and documents. Crypto companies have sustained significant losses through wallet compromises as a result of these hacks; it is not just limited to your personal wallets!

Consider making a public statement to this effect to also warn people who you may not know, but could still be targeted - if you have been compromised, it is highly likely that this will become public knowledge very quickly, so any steps which can be taken to mitigate further loss are recommended.

Document + report any stolen assets.

- Check all of your wallets and centralized exchange accounts for any suspicious activity. If you find unauthorized transactions, please file a report as soon as possible.  

- Local law enforcement  
- ChainAbuse: https://www.chainabuse.com/report  

Include the following information:

- Your on-chain addresses that had assets stolen from them.  
- Primary transaction hashes of your funds being stolen ‚Äî denote the chain/network, or simply link to the block explorer.  
- The addresses the stolen funds were immediately sent to.  
- The social media links/usernames of the scammer(s) (if applicable).  
- The website URL you were directed to and/or downloaded the malicious application from (if applicable).  
- Any other suspicious or irregular activity on your accounts.  
- A concise summary/timeline told from your point of view of what happened.  

Example:

- On Oct 22, 2024, a user with the handle XXX reached out to me via Telegram.  
- She purported to be an investor and asked to schedule a call.  
- On the date of the scheduled call, she sent me a link to the URL ______.  
- I went to the website for the call but it said there was an error and that it had timed out.  
- I told this to ‚Äú____‚Äù via Telegram and she was not very surprised. She told me to run some code / ‚Äúa script‚Äù to fix the issue. I did so but it did not fix the issue. We re-scheduled the call.  
- Here is the code she sent me to run that I ran via Apple Script Editor: ________  
- On Oct 23, 2024, I noticed assets were being stolen from my accounts. In total, approximately $200k worth of crypto was stolen from me.  
  - Here is my first address: ____  
  - Here is my other address: ____  
  - Here is one transaction where $50k worth of USDT was stolen: ____  
- On Oct 23, 2024, I was also logged out of my Telegram account with the handle @____. I have not been able to access the account.  
- On Oct 23, 2024, I was also logged out of my Twitter account @____. I have not been able to log in there either.  
- On Oct 24, 2024, someone attempted to login to my Bitgo account with the IP address ____ but they were not able to.  

Get a new device or wipe the existing device. In order to safely use your device again, you must perform a full factory reset including reformatting the hard disk. Some guides on how to do this are here:

- MacOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/102664  
- Windows (10 and 11): https://nordvpn.com/blog/wipe-computer-hard-drive/  

If you are not able to confidently do this yourself, please either take your device to your nearest Apple Store (if Mac) or computer store (if Windows), explain to them that you have been compromised by a Remote Access Trojan and let a professional wipe the device.

For some folks, they find it easier to simply purchase a new device. Either way, you will be starting fresh with this new device.

Do **NOT** restore the entire device from a Time Machine or similar backup. You can move files from other locations manually, but do not copy the entire home folder / user folder over to your new device. Do not restore from backup. Doing so puts you at risk of reinstalling the backdoor/malware/trojan.

Stay on the lookout for any attempted logins or new login notifications. This is an indication that you are still compromised somewhere.

Did you actually keep your device off? Did you actually change all your passwords?

Harden your security:

- Set up MFA via Google Authenticator with Cloud sync turned OFF.  
- Start using a Password Manager if you haven't already.  
- Get a Ledger or Trezor AND USE IT PROPERLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!  
- Further secure your Twitter account(s).  
- Further secure your Telegram account(s).
