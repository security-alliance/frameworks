# Incident Detection and Response
tag: [Security Specialist, Operations & Strategy]

You don't want to be that project which has funds stolen, and then don't notice it for multiple days. Early detection and effective response to security incidents will help minimize damage.

## Key Components of Incident Detection

- **Monitoring and Logging**: Implement continuous monitoring and logging of on-chain activity for your project to understand when something is behaving out of the ordinary. Also implement monitoring of system events, and user behavior to detect anomalies and potential security incidents in non-on-chain systems such as web applications or cloud environments.

## Key Components of Incident Response

- **Incident Response Team (IRT)**: Establish a dedicated IRT with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
- **Incident Response Plan (IRP)**: Develop and maintain an IRP that outlines the procedures for detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents.
- **Containment**: Implement strategies to contain the incident.
- **Recovery and Remediation**: Ensure that everything is restored to normal operation and take steps to prevent future incidents.
- **Post-Incident Review**: Conduct a thorough review of the incident to identify lessons learned and improve future response efforts.
