## Introduction
This is a short guide prepared by **SEAL** that will help you navigate a malware infection.  
You have a limited amount of time to reduce the amount of damage that can be done to you.  
If you need help at any point, contact [**SEAL 911**](https://t.me/seal_911_bot)

## Secure your crypto assets
The hackers have automatically stolen your crypto wallets, private keys, seed phrases, and credentials from:  

- Browser extension wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, Rabby, Coinbase Wallet, etc)  
- Hardware wallet applications (Ledger Live, SafePal, etc)  
- Local node wallets (Ethereum node keystore, Bitcoin node wallets, etc)  
- Password managers (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, etc)  
- Cloud storage (iCloud, Google Drive, etc)  
- Centralized exchanges (Coinbase, Binance, etc)  
- And more  

**You need to:**  
1. Prioritize the wallets with the highest value.  
2. Create a new wallet from a clean device (phone, tablet, other computer) and write the seed phrase down on paper.  
3. Move all assets out from your old wallets, starting with tokens/NFTs/admin roles and ending with the native token (such as ETH).  

 If you need information from your compromised device, do **not** reconnect it to the internet, or the hackers will continue stealing your data.

## Sweeper bots
The hackers may have installed “sweeper bots” on your addresses.  
These bots automatically “sweep” tokens to their wallets, but might not be able to handle non-tokenized deposits or protocols that require complex withdrawals.  

If your address has been swept, do not withdraw any additional assets without consulting [**SEAL 911**](https://t.me/seal_911_bot) or [**Flashbots Whitehats**.](https://whitehat.flashbots.net/)

## Notify your colleagues and friends
The hackers may try to use the files and data they stole from your computer to impersonate you and scam/hack people in your network. 
If you work at a crypto protocol, the hackers may try to leverage your access to steal internal files and private keys and hack your protocol.

**You need to:**  
- Notify your company’s security/IT team or your coworkers.  
- Notify trusted peers in your network.  

Here’s a copy/paste message you can send:  

> *Hey, I think my computer was infected by malware and my wallets/accounts might be hacked.  
> I’m currently working with SEAL 911 on next steps.  
> Please don’t trust any suspicious messages from me until you can fully confirm that I’ve recovered my accounts.  
> Help me spread the word.*

## Secure your accounts
The hackers may have stolen active login sessions and passwords from:  

- Browsers (Chrome, Brave, Firefox, etc)  
- Desktop applications (Telegram, WhatsApp, etc)  
- Password managers (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass, etc)  

**Accounts at risk include:**  
- Telegram  
- Twitter  
- Discord  
- Email (Google, Apple, Proton, etc)  
- Password managers  
- Company accounts (Okta, Slack, etc)  
- Social media  
- Online banking  
- Cloud storage  

**You need to:**  
- Log in from a clean device  
- Log out all other active sessions  
- Change your password  
- Activate or reset 2FA

## Notify the authorities
If assets were stolen or accounts were taken over, begin legal reporting.  

Collect this information:  
- Stolen wallet addresses + chains  
- Transactions involved  
- Hacker accounts (Telegram, Twitter, etc)  
- URLs you visited or downloaded files from  
- Any other suspicious activity  
- A timeline of events  

**Where to file reports:**  
- [IC3.gov](https://www.ic3.gov) (even if you’re not in the US)  
- [Chainabuse.com](https://www.chainabuse.com)  
- [SEAL 911](https://t.me/seal_911_bot)  
- Your local police  

### Example timeline:
**October 22, 2024**  
- [USERNAME] reached out to me on Telegram, pretending to be an investor from [VC FIRM].  
- Sent me a link to join a call.  
- I followed instructions, but the call failed.  
- After following site instructions, my machine was compromised.  

**October 23, 2024**  
- ~$200k stolen from these wallets: [ADDRESS 1], [ADDRESS 2]  
- Lost access to Telegram/Twitter accounts  
- Received login attempt alerts from Bitgo ([IP])

## Get a new computer
Your compromised computer is no longer safe to use. You can either:

- **Get a new computer** If you work for a large company, you may want to send your 
compromised computer to a forensics company for further analysis or for regulatory compliance. 
If so, you will need to buy a new computer.

- **Wipe your existing computer** If you feel comfortable with performing a full factory reset of your computer, you can do so yourself. 
If not, you may consider bringing it to a local technician (such as an Apple store, Geek Squad, or similar). 
Some people find it easier to simply buy a new computer.
 

You must **start fresh** from this computer:  

- **Do not restore your device from backup** (such as Time Machine, Windows Backup, or any third-party backup programs), or you may restore the malware as well.  

- If you need to copy files from the compromised computer:  
  - Do **not** connect it to the internet (or the malware may continue stealing your data).  
  - Do **not** copy your entire user folder (or you may copy the malware).

# Stay vigilant

The hackers may have stolen additional logins that you were not aware of, or you may have not fully removed the infection.  
If you notice additional signs of compromise, such as login alerts, randomly being logged out of services, or crypto being stolen, you will need to follow this guide again.

## If you don’t already, consider following these best practices to keep yourself safe online:

- Use a password manager (but not LastPass)  
- Turn on 2FA where available (disable cloud backups in your 2FA app)  
- Use a hardware wallet
