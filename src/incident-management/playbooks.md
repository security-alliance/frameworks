# Playbooks
tag: [Security Specialist, Operations & Strategy]
Generally speaking, incident response playbooks aim to provide detailed, step-by-step procedures for handling specific types of security incidents. Obviously, it's not possible to have thought about every possible scenario ahead of time, but one could create documentation for the most likely or devastating scenarios.

## Best Practices

1. Define the type of incident the playbook addresses (e.g., stolen funds, data breach, DDoS attack).
2. Outline the steps for detecting and analyzing the incident, including key indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tools to use.
3. Describe immediate actions to contain the incident and prevent further damage.
4. Provide detailed steps for eradicating the root cause of the incident.
5. Outline procedures for restoring everything affected to normal operation.
6. Detail the steps for conducting a lessons learned review.
