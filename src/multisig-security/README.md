## How to use this guide

**Quick start**: New to multisigs? Start with Section 1 for the essentials, then jump to your role:
- Setting up a new multisig? → Section 3 (Multisig Administration)
- Joining as a signer? → Section 4 (For Signers)
- Need to sign a transaction? → Section 4.4 (Transaction Verification)
- Emergency situation? → Section 4.5 (Emergency procedures)

**Reference use**: Each section is designed to stand alone. Use the table of contents to jump directly to what you need.

## Core principles

- **Security first**: Every multisig must meet minimum security standards
- **Operational readiness**: Procedures that work under pressure
- **Clear accountability**: Everyone knows their role and responsibilities
- **Emergency preparedness**: Plans for when things go wrong
