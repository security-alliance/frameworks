# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist, Operations & Strategy, Devops, HR]

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to systems and data based on the roles assigned to individual users within an project. RBAC ensures that users have the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.

## Key Principles of RBAC

- **Role Definition**: Clearly define roles within the project based on the team member's job responsibility. Each role should have a specific set of permissions, for example a community manager could potentially not require administrative permissions to the project's github repository.
- **Role Assignment**: Assign roles to team members based on their job responsibilities. Ensure that users only have access to the resources they need.
- **Permission Management**: Regularly review and update role permissions to ensure they are aligned with current team functions and security requirements.
- **Separation of Duties**: Implement separation of duties to prevent conflicts of interest and reduce the risk of threats.
