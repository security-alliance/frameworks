# Access Management Best Practices

Effective access management involves ensuring that users have the right access, at the right time, and that access is promptly revoked when no longer needed. Implementing access management practices helps prevent unauthorized access, and reduces the risk of insider threats.

## Practices for Access Management

- **Just-In-Time Access**: Implement just-in-time (JIT) access to provide users with temporary access when needed. This minimizes the risk of long-term access being misused.
- **Timely Access Revocation**: Ensure that access is revoked in a timely manner for users who are no longer part of the organization or whose roles within the project have changed.
- **Access Reviews**: Conduct regular access reviews to ensure that team members have appropriate access based on their current functions.
- **On-boarding and Off-boarding Processes**: Establish clear processes for on-boarding new team members and off-boarding departing team members to ensure that access is granted and revoked as appropriate.
- **Access Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring of access to critical services to detect and respond to unauthorized access attempts.

## Best Practices for Access Management

1. Grant users the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions.
2. Ensure that critical tasks require multiple users to perform, reducing the risk of misuse.
3. When possible, use automated tools to manage access provisioning and revocation based on user lifecycle events.
