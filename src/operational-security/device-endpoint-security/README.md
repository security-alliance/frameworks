# Device and Endpoint Security

Securing the devices used by your organization is a critical component of operational security. Endpoints such as laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and servers are common entry points for attackers and require robust protection.

## Introduction

Device and endpoint security encompasses the policies, tools, and practices that protect individual computing devices from threats. As the boundary between work and personal devices blurs, and as remote work becomes more common, securing endpoints has become increasingly challenging and important.

## Key Components

This section covers the following aspects of device and endpoint security:

1. [Standard Operating Environment](./standard-operating-environment.md) - Establishing and maintaining secure baseline configurations
2. [Endpoint Protection](./endpoint-protection.md) - Tools and technologies to protect endpoints from malware and other threats
3. [Mobile Device Security](./mobile-device-security.md) - Securing smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices
4. [Secure Configuration](./secure-configuration.md) - Hardening devices through secure configuration practices
5. [Patch Management](./patch-management.md) - Keeping systems updated to address known vulnerabilities

## Risk-Based Approach

Device and endpoint security should be implemented based on the sensitivity of the data being handled and the criticality of the device to operations:

1. Inventory all devices that access organizational resources
2. Classify devices based on the data they handle and criticality to operations
3. Implement appropriate security controls based on risk levels
4. Regularly audit device compliance with security policies

## Web3 Considerations

In Web3 environments, device and endpoint security includes additional considerations:

- Securing devices used for cryptocurrency transactions and key management
- Protecting hardware wallets and other specialized Web3 hardware
- Addressing the risks of browser-based Web3 interactions
- Securing devices that participate in blockchain networks (e.g., validator nodes)

The guidance in this section addresses both traditional and Web3-specific device and endpoint security considerations.
