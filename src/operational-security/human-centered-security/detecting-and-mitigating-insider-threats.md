# Detecting and Mitigating Insider Threats


Insider threats, whether intentional or unintentional, pose a significant risk to any project. These threats can come from current or former employees, contractors, or business associates who have inside information concerning the project's security practices, data, and computer systems. Effective detection and mitigation strategies are crucial for safeguarding your project against these risks.

## What Are Insider Threats?

Insider threats can be categorized into three main types:

1. **Malicious Insiders**: Individuals who intentionally cause harm to the project by stealing data, sabotaging systems, or leaking sensitive information.
2. **Negligent Insiders**: Team members who unintentionally cause security breaches through careless actions, such as falling for phishing attacks or mishandling sensitive data.
3. **Compromised Insiders**: Team members whose accounts or systems are compromised by external threat actors and used to gain access to the project's resources.

## Detecting Insider Threats

### Monitoring and Analytics

1. Implement systems to monitor team member's activity and identify unusual behavior patterns. This includes tracking logins and on-chain transactions related to the project.
2. Use anomaly detection to establish a baseline of normal user behavior and detect deviations that may indicate malicious activity.

### Access Controls

1. Implement RBAC to ensure that employees have access only to the information and systems necessary for their job functions.
2. Enforce the principle of least privilege, granting users the minimum level of access required to perform their duties.
3. Conduct regular reviews of user access permissions to ensure they are still appropriate for their current roles.

### Training and Awareness

1. Conduct regular security training sessions to educate employees about the risks of insider threats and the importance of following security protocols.
2. Run (spear) phishing simulations to test employees' awareness and response to potential (spear) phishing attacks.

## Mitigating Insider Threats

### Incident Response Plan

1. Create a detailed [incident response plan](../incident-management/README.md) that outlines the steps to be taken in the event of an insider threat incident.
2. Clearly define roles and responsibilities for the incident response team to ensure a coordinated and effective response.

### Technical Controls

1. Require MFA for access to critical systems and sensitive data to add an extra layer of security.
2. Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit to protect it from unauthorized access.

### Project Policies

1. Establish clear policies and procedures for handling sensitive information and responding to security incidents.
2. Be aware that malicious organizations/countries may try to obtain access to your project for reasons of financial or technology theft. Conduct thorough background checks on new employees and contractors to identify potential risks.
3. Implement strict exit procedures for departing employees, including revoking access to systems and multi-signature wallets.

### Behavioral and Cultural Measures

1. Foster a culture of security awareness where team members understand the importance of protecting sensitive information and reporting suspicious activities.
