# Core OpSec Principles

Operational security is built on fundamental principles that guide the implementation of security controls and practices. These principles provide a foundation for developing a comprehensive security posture that protects your organization's assets, operations, and reputation.

> **Practical Example: Web3 Organization**
>
> Consider a Web3 project managing a DeFi protocol with a treasury of $10M in assets. Proper operational security would involve:
>
> - **Multiple security layers**: Hardware wallets for cold storage, multi-signature requirements for transactions, regular security audits, and continuous monitoring
> - **Access control**: Only specific team members have access to deployment keys, with different permission levels for development, testing, and production environments
> - **Compartmentalized information**: Private keys for multi-signature wallets are distributed among trusted team members with no single person having access to all keys, and sensitive incident response procedures are only shared with the security team
> - **Regular threat assessment**: The team conducts quarterly reviews of potential attack vectors, from smart contract vulnerabilities to [social engineering](../awareness/social-engineering.md) attempts targeting team members

## Defense in Depth

Defense in Depth is the practice of layering security controls throughout your systems and processes, so that if one control fails, others will provide protection.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** This principle is applied across multiple frameworks including [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/) with [Zero-Trust Principles](../infrastructure/zero-trust-principles.md) and [Network Security](../infrastructure/network-security.md).

### Implementation

1. Deploy multiple security controls that address the same risk in different ways
2. Implement security at various layers: physical, technical, administrative, and human
3. Ensure no single point of failure exists in your security architecture
4. Review the effectiveness of security layers regularly to identify gaps
5. Foster a [security-aware mindset](../awareness/cultivating-a-security-aware-mindset.md) across all team members

## Principle of Least Privilege

The Principle of Least Privilege dictates that users, systems, and processes should have only the minimum access rights necessary to perform their functions.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For comprehensive implementation, see [Identity and Access Management](../iam/) and [Role-Based Access Control](../iam/role-based-access-control.md).

### Implementation

1. Grant the minimum level of access required for users to perform their duties
2. Review and adjust access rights when roles change
3. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to standardize permissions
4. Use time-limited and just-in-time access for administrative privileges
5. Regularly audit access rights to identify and remove excessive permissions
6. Establish a thorough offboarding process to immediately revoke access when team members leave
7. Remove credentials for deactivated accounts, as these can become security liabilities even when dormant

## Need-to-Know Basis

Information should only be shared with individuals who require that information to perform their duties.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** This principle is supported by practices in [Data Protection](../operational-security/data-protection/) and aspects of [Privacy](../privacy/).

### Implementation

1. Classify information based on sensitivity and restrict access accordingly
2. Compartmentalize sensitive information to limit exposure in case of a breach
3. Implement clear data handling and sharing policies
4. Train team members on proper handling and sharing of sensitive information through regular [security training](../awareness/security-training.md)
5. Use secure communication channels for sensitive information

## Threat Modeling for OpSec

Threat modeling involves systematically identifying potential threats, vulnerabilities, and attack vectors to prioritize security controls.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For detailed methodology and implementation, see the [Threat Modeling](../threat-modeling/) framework, including guides on how to [Create and Maintain Threat Models](../threat-modeling/create-maintain-threat-models.md) and [Identify and Mitigate Threats](../threat-modeling/identity-mitigate-threats.md).

### Implementation

1. Identify critical assets and operations that need protection
2. Enumerate potential threats and their impact on your organization
3. Assess vulnerabilities that could be exploited
4. Evaluate existing controls and their effectiveness
5. Develop a prioritized plan to address identified risks
6. Maintain awareness of common [threat vectors](../awareness/understanding-threat-vectors.md) relevant to your organization

## Risk Assessment and Management

Systematic evaluation and prioritization of security risks to guide resource allocation and security decision-making.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For comprehensive risk management strategies, refer to [Governance](../governance/) and [Risk Management](../governance/risk-management.md).

### Implementation

1. Identify and categorize assets based on their value and criticality
2. Assess threats and vulnerabilities relevant to those assets
3. Determine the likelihood and potential impact of security incidents
4. Implement controls based on risk levels
5. Regularly reassess risks as the environment and threats evolve

## Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

Security is not a one-time implementation but a continuous process of monitoring, evaluating, and improving.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For implementation details, see the [Monitoring](../monitoring/) framework, including [Guidelines](../monitoring/guidelines.md) and [Thresholds](../monitoring/thresholds.md). Also relevant is [Incident Management](../incident-management/) for response to detected issues.

### Implementation

1. Establish security metrics to measure the effectiveness of controls
2. Implement monitoring systems to detect security events and anomalies
3. Conduct regular security assessments and penetration tests
4. Learn from security incidents and near-misses
5. Update security controls based on new threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies
6. Ensure team members are [staying informed and continuously learning](../awareness/staying-informed-and-continuous-learning.md) about evolving security threats
7. Utilize available [security resources](../awareness/resources-and-further-reading.md) to keep your security practices current

## Web3-Specific OpSec Principles

In addition to traditional OpSec principles, Web3 environments require consideration of:

> **🔗 Related Framework:** Explore the dedicated [Web3-Specific OpSec](../operational-security/web3-specific-opsec/) framework for comprehensive guidance.

### Transparency vs. Privacy

Balancing the transparent nature of blockchain with the need for operational privacy.

### Implementation

1. Understand what information is publicly visible on-chain
2. Develop strategies to maintain operational privacy while utilizing public blockchains
3. Use privacy-enhancing technologies where appropriate

### Immutability and Finality

Recognizing that blockchain transactions are generally irreversible, requiring heightened security before execution.

### Implementation

1. Implement robust verification procedures before executing transactions
2. Use multi-signature requirements for high-value transactions
3. Deploy transaction simulation tools to verify outcomes before execution

### Self-Custody Responsibility

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For detailed guidance on wallet security practices, see the [Wallet Security](../wallet-security/) framework.

### Implementation

1. Develop clear procedures for wallet security
2. Implement separation of duties for transaction approval
3. Balance security with operational efficiency
4. [Stay up-to-date](../awareness/staying-up-to-date.md) with best practices in wallet security and custody solutions

By adhering to these core principles, organizations can build a strong foundation for operational security that addresses both traditional and Web3-specific security challenges.
