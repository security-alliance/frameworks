## 1. Use Two-Step Verification
- **Enable Two-Step Verification:** Protect your account with an additional password to ensure that even if someone has your phone number, they cannot access your account without the additional password.
  - Go to **Settings** > **Privacy and Security** > **Two-Step Verification** and set up a password.

## 2. Enable End-to-End Encryption for Secret Chats
- **Use Secret Chats:** For sensitive conversations, use Telegram's Secret Chats, which are end-to-end encrypted and not stored on Telegramâ€™s servers.
  - Start a new secret chat by selecting a contact, tapping on their name at the top, and choosing **Start Secret Chat**.

## 3. Set Self-Destruct Timers for Messages
- **Self-Destruct Timers:** In Secret Chats, set a self-destruct timer for messages, which automatically deletes messages after a set period of time.
  - Tap the clock icon in the message input bar within a secret chat to set the timer.

## 4. Control Your Online Presence

## 5. Limit Who Can Add You to Groups
- **Group and Channel Privacy:** Restrict who can add you to groups or channels to prevent being added to unwanted or potentially malicious groups.
