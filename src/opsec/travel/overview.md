## Three-phase Security Approach

Our travel security framework is organized into three critical phases:

1. **Pre-travel preparation**: Risk assessment, device hardening, backup creation, and contingency planning
2. **On-trip vigilance**: Network security, physical device protection, social engineering awareness, and maintaining operational security
3. **Post-travel review**: Device inspection, account security verification, and lessons learned documentation

Additional considerations are provided for high-risk travelers who may face targeted threats due to their role or access to valuable assets.
