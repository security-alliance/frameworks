# Personal security travel guide â€” concise version

> ðŸ”‘ Key Takeaway: Protect your digital assets while traveling through minimizing sensitive data, using encrypted devices, avoiding public networks, securing hardware wallets, maintaining physical control of devices, being cautious with USB connections, practicing social discretion, and sanitizing devices upon return.

## Before traveling  
- Remove or securely store any data, devices, or documents not essential for the trip. Less sensitive material reduces risk if lost or stolen.  
- Perform a quick threat model: list what you carry, who may target you, and how. Plan mitigations accordingly.  
- Enable full-disk encryption on all devices; update OS, firmware, and apps before departure.  
- Back up devices, record serial numbers and IMEI, and verify Mobile Device Management (MDM) enrollment and "Find My" functionality.  
- Print or securely store backup 2FA codes; disable SMS-based 2FA if possible. Use eSIM or secondary numbers for authentication.  
- Use password manager travel modes to hide sensitive vaults while away.  
- Update and test hardware wallets; never travel with written seed phrases.  
- Carry hardware wallets and 2FA tokens on your person; keep spares securely at home.  
- Use strong phone passcodes; disable biometrics in risky scenarios; enable Lockdown Mode if available.  
- Minimize your digital footprint: avoid public travel announcements and crypto branding.  
- Prepare an emergency plan: who to notify if devices are lost or compromised, and how to revoke access quickly.  
- Research local laws on encryption and tech; carry travel letters or sanitized devices if needed for border crossings.

## While traveling  
- Prefer cellular data or personal hotspots over public Wi-Fi; disable automatic Wi-Fi connections.  
- Use a trusted VPN and consider a portable router to encrypt traffic on public networks.  
- Turn off Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, AirDrop, and Nearby Share when not in use to reduce attack surface.  
- Keep devices on you or locked; use cable locks and hotel safes.  
- Avoid public USB charging stations ("juice jacking"); use your own charger or a USB data blocker.  
- Use privacy screens on laptops and phones; be mindful of shoulder surfing and phishing attempts.  
- Don't discuss sensitive information publicly; be alert for hidden cameras or microphones in accommodations.  
- Use passphrases on wallets and multisig setups for large crypto holdings.  
- Separate hardware wallets and keys from the devices they authenticate.  
- Consider portable door locks and tamper-evident bags to secure your room and devices overnight.

## Returning home  
- Change passwords and verify 2FA on accounts accessed during travel, preferably from trusted devices and networks.  
- Scan devices for malware and unusual behavior; factory reset if you suspect compromise.  
- Inspect hardware wallets for tampering; transfer funds if compromised or suspicious.  
- Remove travel-specific SIMs, accounts, or apps no longer needed.  
- Report incidents to your security or IT team; share lessons learned to improve future security.

## High-risk traveler extras  
- Use burner or loaner devices with minimal data; assume they may be compromised and plan to wipe them post-trip.  
- Power down and encrypt devices before border crossings to limit data exposure.  
- Disable biometrics completely pre-travel to avoid compelled unlocks.  
- Enable Lockdown Mode and use end-to-end encrypted messaging apps (e.g., Signal).  
- Use Faraday bags and tamper-evident seals to prevent tracking and unauthorized device access.  
- Physically inspect devices before and after travel for signs of tampering or implants.  
- Increase multisig signer requirements while traveling; geographically split key custody.  
- Use duress codes if supported by hardware wallets.  
- Establish secure emergency check-ins and code words with your team for rapid response.
