# The Five Steps of the OpSec Process

## 1. Identification of Critical Information

Determine what information, if obtained by adversaries, could harm your organization or operations.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** This step aligns with [Asset Inventory](../infrastructure/asset-inventory.md) practices and informs [Data Protection](../operational-security/data-protection/) strategies.

### Implementation

1. Create an inventory of all sensitive information assets
2. Classify information based on sensitivity and impact if compromised
3. Document where critical information is stored, processed, and transmitted
4. Identify the owners and authorized users of each information asset
5. Regularly review and update your critical information inventory

## 2. Threat Analysis

Identify potential adversaries, their capabilities, and their interest in your critical information.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For detailed approaches, see [Understanding Threat Vectors](../awareness/understanding-threat-vectors.md) and [Threat Modeling](../threat-modeling/) frameworks.

### Implementation

1. Research known threat actors relevant to your industry or organization
2. Analyze adversaries' motivations, resources, and methods
3. Consider both external threats (hackers, competitors) and internal threats (insiders)
4. Stay informed about emerging threats and attack techniques
5. Document threat scenarios specific to your organization's context

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment

Analyze how your critical information might be exposed through vulnerabilities in your systems, processes, or personnel.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** This connects with [Security Testing](../security-testing/) framework, including [Static Application Security Testing](../security-testing/static-application-security-testing.md) and [Dynamic Application Security Testing](../security-testing/dynamic-application-security-testing.md).

### Implementation

1. Conduct technical vulnerability scans of systems and networks
2. Review processes and procedures for security gaps
3. Assess personnel security awareness and adherence to security policies
4. Examine physical security controls protecting critical assets
5. Evaluate third-party and supply chain vulnerabilities that could impact your organization

## 4. Risk Assessment

Evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of various threats exploiting identified vulnerabilities.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For comprehensive approaches, see [Governance](../governance/) and [Risk Management](../governance/risk-management.md) frameworks.

### Implementation

1. Calculate risk based on threat probability and potential impact
2. Prioritize risks based on severity and criticality to operations
3. Document acceptable risk thresholds for different types of assets
4. Consider cascading effects of security compromises
5. Present risk assessments in clear terms for executive decision-making

## 5. Countermeasure Implementation

Develop and deploy security controls to mitigate identified risks, considering cost, effectiveness, and operational impact.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** Implementation connects with [Security Automation](../security-automation/) and various control frameworks like [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/) and [Identity and Access Management](../iam/).

### Implementation

1. Select appropriate technical, administrative, and physical controls
2. Implement controls based on risk prioritization
3. Test controls to ensure they function as intended
4. Document procedures for maintaining and updating controls
5. Train personnel on new security measures and their importance

Threat modeling is a structured approach to identifying, assessing, and mitigating security threats. It involves:

- Identifying assets that need protection
- Mapping out potential attack vectors
- Analyzing potential threat actors and their capabilities
- Determining the likelihood and impact of various threats
- Developing strategies to address identified threats

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For detailed methodology and implementation, see the [Threat Modeling](../threat-modeling/) framework, including guides on how to [Create and Maintain Threat Models](../threat-modeling/create-maintain-threat-models.md) and [Identify and Mitigate Threats](../threat-modeling/identity-mitigate-threats.md).

### Implementation

1. Identify critical assets and operations that need protection
2. Enumerate potential threats and their impact on your organization
3. Assess vulnerabilities that could be exploited
4. Evaluate existing controls and their effectiveness
5. Develop a prioritized plan to address identified risks
6. Maintain awareness of common [threat vectors](../awareness/understanding-threat-vectors.md) relevant to your organization

Effective threat modeling requires a comprehensive understanding of your systems, data flows, and potential adversaries.

## 3. Risk Assessment and Management

Systematic evaluation and prioritization of security risks to guide resource allocation and security decision-making.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For comprehensive risk management strategies, refer to [Governance](../governance/) and [Risk Management](../governance/risk-management.md).

### Implementation

1. Identify and categorize assets based on their value and criticality
2. Assess threats and vulnerabilities relevant to those assets
3. Determine the likelihood and potential impact of security incidents
4. Implement controls based on risk levels
5. Regularly reassess risks as the environment and threats evolve
