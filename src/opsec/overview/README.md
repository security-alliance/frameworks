# Overview

Operational Security (OpSec) is a practical approach that helps organizations protect sensitive information and critical assets through both foundational security concepts and actionable implementation processes. This section covers the essential frameworks that form the basis of an effective operational security program.

## What is Operational Security?

Operational Security is a systematic process that:

1. Maps and secures critical information and assets
2. Identifies and analyzes relevant threats
3. Discovers and addresses exploitable vulnerabilities
4. Evaluates risks in a business context
5. Deploys targeted controls to mitigate identified risks

The goal is to prevent unauthorized access to systems and information that could cause operational, financial, or reputational harm if compromised.

## Security Fundamentals

The following fundamentals form the foundation of effective operational security:

- **Layered Protection**: Implementing multiple overlapping security controls so that if one mechanism fails, others will continue to protect your assets.
- **Minimal Access Scopes**: Granting users, systems, and processes only the specific permissions they need to perform their required functions and nothing more.
- **Information Flow Control**: Ensuring sensitive information is only accessible to those with a legitimate need to know, with restrictions on how that information can be shared and used.
- **System Isolation**: Segmenting systems and networks into isolated zones to contain security breaches and limit lateral movement.
- **Continuous Visibility**: Maintaining ongoing awareness of your security posture through active monitoring, testing, and continuous improvement.

Check the [Security Fundamentals](./security-fundamentals.md) for practical application guidance.

## Operational Implementation Process

1. **Critical Asset Identification**: Map and document the assets that would cause significant harm to your organization if compromised.
2. **Practical Threat Analysis**: Identify specific, relevant threat actors and their tactics based on your organization's profile.
3. **Actionable Vulnerability Assessment**: Systematically identify and validate weaknesses in your environment through practical testing.
4. **Contextual Risk Evaluation**: Analyze identified risks in the context of your business to drive informed decision-making.
5. **Targeted Control Deployment**: Implement security controls that address prioritized risks while minimizing operational friction.

Check out the [Operational Implementation Process](./implementation-process.md) for detailed implementation actions.

## Web3-Specific Considerations

In Web3 environments, operational security must address unique challenges:

- **Transparency vs. Privacy**: Balancing blockchain transparency with the need for operational secrecy
- **Decentralized Operations**: Securing operations across distributed teams and systems
- **Cryptocurrency Security**: Protecting digital assets and private keys
- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**: Addressing the immutable nature of deployed code
- **Community Dynamics**: Managing security in open, community-driven projects

Check out [Web3 considerations](./web3-considerations.md) for more details on these topics.
