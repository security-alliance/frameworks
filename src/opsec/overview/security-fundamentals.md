# Security Fundamentals

> ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway**: Effective security operations are built on five practical fundamentals: layered protective measures, minimized access scopes, controlled information flows, system isolation, and continuous visibility â€” working together to secure critical assets in dynamic environments.

## Relationship to Implementation Process

This document outlines the foundational security approaches that should be embedded throughout your organization's operations. They complement the practical [Operational Implementation Process](implementation-process.md), which defines specific action steps:

- These fundamentals establish **enduring approaches** that shape your security architecture
- The implementation process provides a **sequential workflow** for security teams to follow

While these fundamentals provide the security principles that should be consistently applied across your environment, the implementation process offers a structured methodology for putting security into practice. Both elements must work in concert - these fundamentals guide your overall approach, while the implementation process provides the tactical roadmap.

For organizations just beginning their security journey, start with the [Operational Implementation Process](implementation-process.md) for concrete steps.

The ultimate goal is to prevent unauthorized access to systems and information that could cause operational, financial, or reputational harm if compromised.

> **Practical Example: Web3 Organization**
>
> Consider a Web3 project managing a DeFi protocol with a treasury of $10M in assets. Practical security fundamentals in action include:
>
> - **Layered protection**: Hardware security modules for key storage, multi-signature requirements (3-of-5) for transactions, automated monitoring for unusual patterns, and regular third-party security audits
> - **Minimal access scopes**: Deployment keys accessible only to specific DevOps team members, with different permission levels strictly enforced between development, staging, and production environments
> - **Information flow control**: Private keys for multi-signature wallets distributed among trusted team members based on role, with sensitive incident response procedures restricted to the security team
> - **System isolation**: Clear separation between development environments and production systems, with treasury management isolated from day-to-day operations
> - **Continuous visibility**: Real-time monitoring systems tracking transaction patterns, weekly security reviews, and quarterly penetration tests with findings addressed in prioritized sprints

## 1. Layered Protection

Implement multiple overlapping security controls so that if one mechanism fails, others will continue to protect your assets.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** This approach is reinforced in frameworks like [Infrastructure](../infrastructure/) with [Zero-Trust Principles](../infrastructure/zero-trust-principles.md) and [Network Security](../infrastructure/network-security.md).

### Practical Application

1. Implement multiple defensive mechanisms that protect against the same risks using different methods
   - Example: Protect admin interfaces using network ACLs, MFA, time-limited access windows, and anomaly detection
2. Deploy protection at each layer of your technology stack
   - Network layer: Firewalls, network segmentation, DDoS protection
   - Host layer: Endpoint protection, host-based IDS, secure configuration
   - Application layer: Input validation, output encoding, API security
   - Data layer: Encryption, access controls, data loss prevention
3. Identify and eliminate single points of failure in your security architecture
   - Map defense coverage to ensure overlapping protections
   - Document security dependencies and create contingency plans
4. Test defensive layers regularly through realistic scenarios
   - Conduct tabletop exercises focused on specific defensive failures
   - Use red team exercises to validate defense-in-depth effectiveness
5. Maintain a continuous improvement cycle for each defensive layer
   - Review and update security controls after incidents or near-misses
   - Track industry developments to identify emerging defensive tactics

## 2. Minimal Access Scopes

Grant users, systems, and processes only the specific permissions they need to perform their required functions and nothing more.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For detailed implementation, see [Identity and Access Management](../iam/) and [Role-Based Access Control](../iam/role-based-access-control.md).

### Practical Application

1. Implement a structured permission model that starts with zero access
   - Default deny: Require explicit permission grants for all access
   - Document justification for each permission granted
   - Create standardized role templates for common job functions
2. Establish automated processes for access lifecycle management
   - Onboarding: Provision minimal initial access based on role
   - Role changes: Adjust permissions when responsibilities change
   - Offboarding: Remove all access immediately upon departure
3. Apply time-based restrictions to elevated privileges
   - Use just-in-time access for administrative functions
   - Implement automatic session termination after periods of inactivity
   - Require re-authentication for sensitive operations
4. Conduct regular access reviews with verification
   - Quarterly: Review all privileged accounts and service accounts
   - Semi-annually: Audit all standard user accounts and group memberships
   - Use automated tools to identify inactive or excessive permissions
5. Implement technical controls to enforce minimal access
   - Application permissions: API scopes, feature flags, entitlement checks
   - Infrastructure permissions: IAM policies, network ACLs, resource policies
   - Database permissions: Row-level security, column-level controls

## 3. Information Flow Control

Ensure sensitive information is only accessible to those with a legitimate need to know, with restrictions on how that information can be shared and used.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** This approach is supported by practices in [Data Protection](../operational-security/data-protection/) and aspects of [Privacy](../privacy/).

### Practical Application

1. Implement a practical data classification system with clear handling requirements
   - Public: Information approved for general distribution
   - Internal: Business information for employee use only
   - Confidential: Sensitive information requiring specific protections
   - Restricted: Critical information with strictly controlled access
2. Define and enforce data handling procedures for each classification level
   - Storage requirements: Where information can be stored
   - Transmission rules: How information can be sent/shared
   - Processing restrictions: How information can be used
   - Retention limits: How long information should be kept
3. Deploy technical controls to enforce information flow policies
   - Data loss prevention tools to monitor and block unauthorized sharing
   - Encryption for data at rest and in transit based on sensitivity
   - Information rights management for persistent protection
4. Establish secure channels for different types of communication
   - High-sensitivity: End-to-end encrypted messaging with disappearing messages
   - Medium-sensitivity: Encrypted collaboration platforms with access controls
   - Low-sensitivity: Standard business communication tools
5. Train users on practical information handling procedures
   - Provide clear guidelines with concrete examples
   - Use realistic scenarios in training materials
   - Conduct periodic verification checks

## 4. System Isolation

Segment systems and networks into isolated zones to contain security breaches and limit lateral movement.

### Practical Application

1. Implement network segmentation based on security requirements
   - Create security zones with consistent trust levels
   - Implement strict traffic control between zones
   - Document and regularly review allowed communication paths
2. Establish environment separation with controlled boundaries
   - Maintain distinct development, testing, staging, and production environments
   - Implement one-way data flows from higher to lower environments
   - Control code promotion processes between environments
3. Isolate high-value systems with enhanced protection
   - Place critical infrastructure on dedicated hardware
   - Example: Run blockchain nodes on dedicated hardware isolated from general workstations
   - Implement jump servers or privileged access workstations for administrative access
4. Apply micro-segmentation where appropriate
   - Container isolation: Enforce pod security policies and network policies
   - Application segmentation: Implement service meshes with mutual TLS
   - Process isolation: Use containerization, virtualization, or sandboxing
5. Monitor and enforce boundary controls
   - Implement egress filtering to control outbound connections
   - Deploy internal firewalls between segments
   - Use network monitoring to detect unauthorized communication attempts

## 5. Continuous Visibility

Maintain ongoing awareness of your security posture through active monitoring, testing, and continuous improvement.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For implementation details, see the [Monitoring](../monitoring/) framework, including [Guidelines](../monitoring/guidelines.md) and [Thresholds](../monitoring/thresholds.md). Also relevant is [Incident Management](../incident-management/) for response to detected issues.

### Practical Application

1. Implement a multi-layered monitoring strategy
   - System monitoring: Performance, availability, and system integrity
   - Security monitoring: Threat detection, anomaly identification, and correlation
   - Compliance monitoring: Policy enforcement and regulatory requirements
   - Establish clear ownership for each monitoring domain
2. Define actionable metrics tied to security objectives
   - Leading indicators: Metrics that help predict future issues
   - Example: Percentage of systems with current patches
   - Lagging indicators: Metrics that measure past performance
   - Example: Mean time to detect and respond to incidents
3. Establish a regular testing cadence to validate security controls
   - Vulnerability scanning: Weekly automated scans
   - Penetration testing: Quarterly focused tests on critical systems
   - Red team exercises: Annual comprehensive assessments
4. Implement a structured incident management process
   - Define clear incident response procedures with specific roles
   - Conduct regular tabletop exercises to practice response
   - Perform thorough post-incident reviews focused on improvement
   - Create feedback loops to security controls based on incidents
5. Maintain an active threat intelligence program
   - Collect intelligence relevant to your specific environment
   - Analyze and contextualize threats for your organization
   - Disseminate actionable intelligence to appropriate teams
   - Use threat intelligence to drive security improvements
