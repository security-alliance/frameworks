# Physical & Environmental Controls

Physical security is a crucial component of operational security that is often overlooked in digital-focused organizations. This section covers controls to protect physical assets, secure workspaces, and address travel security concerns.

## Secure Workspace & Travel Security

Implementing controls to secure physical work environments and protect team members while traveling.

### Secure Workspace Components

1. **Physical Access Controls**: Restricting access to facilities and sensitive areas
2. **Visitor Management**: Procedures for handling visitors and contractors
3. **Clean Desk Policy**: Guidelines for securing sensitive information when not in use
4. **Environmental Monitoring**: Detection of environmental threats (fire, water, etc.)
5. **Equipment Security**: Physical protection of hardware and devices

### Implementation Steps for Workspace Security

1. Implement appropriate physical access controls based on sensitivity
2. Establish visitor management procedures and logging
3. Develop and enforce clean desk and clear screen policies
4. Implement environmental monitoring and response procedures
5. Secure hardware with appropriate physical controls (locks, alarms, etc.)

### Travel Security Components

1. **Pre-Travel Assessment**: Evaluating security risks at destinations
2. **Secure Travel Practices**: Guidelines for secure behavior while traveling
3. **Device Security**: Protecting devices and data during travel
4. **Emergency Response**: Procedures for handling security incidents while traveling
5. **Post-Travel Measures**: Actions to take after returning from high-risk locations

### Implementation Steps for Travel Security

1. Develop pre-travel risk assessment procedures
2. Create travel security guidelines for different risk levels
3. Implement technical controls for devices used during travel
4. Establish emergency response procedures for travelers
5. Develop and enforce post-travel security measures where appropriate

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Remote-First Organizations**: Addressing physical security in distributed teams
2. **Hardware Wallets**: Securing cryptocurrency hardware devices
3. **Conference Security**: Protecting team members at industry events
4. **Pseudonymous Team Members**: Balancing privacy with physical security needs
5. **Doxxing Risks**: Protecting team members from having personal information exposed

## Tamper-Evidence & "Evil-Maid" Attacks

Protecting against physical tampering with devices and equipment, especially when left unattended.

### Key Components

1. **Tamper-Evident Measures**: Physical indicators of device tampering
2. **Device Integrity Verification**: Methods to verify device has not been compromised
3. **Secure Storage**: Protected storage for sensitive devices when not in use
4. **Device Handling Procedures**: Guidelines for maintaining device chain of custody
5. **Response Procedures**: Actions to take when tampering is suspected

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement tamper-evident measures for sensitive devices (seals, markers, etc.)
2. Establish procedures for verifying device integrity after periods of absence
3. Provide secure storage options for devices when not in use
4. Develop clear device handling procedures
5. Create response plans for suspected tampering incidents
6. Train team members on tamper detection and response

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Hardware Wallet Security**: Protecting cryptocurrency hardware devices
2. **Cold Storage**: Physical security for offline key storage
3. **Seed Phrase Protection**: Secure storage of recovery phrases
4. **Air-Gapped Systems**: Maintaining security of isolated systems
5. **Physical Backup Security**: Protecting backup storage media

## Physical Security of Critical Assets

Protecting the physical security of servers, network equipment, and other critical infrastructure.

### Key Components

1. **Asset Inventory**: Cataloging and tracking physical assets
2. **Secure Facilities**: Protected locations for critical infrastructure
3. **Environmental Controls**: Protection against environmental threats
4. **Maintenance Procedures**: Secure processes for equipment maintenance
5. **Disposal Procedures**: Secure disposal of equipment and media

### Implementation Steps

1. Maintain a comprehensive inventory of physical assets
2. Implement appropriate physical security controls for facilities
3. Deploy environmental monitoring and protection systems
4. Establish secure maintenance procedures
5. Develop and enforce secure disposal procedures for equipment and media

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Node Security**: Physical protection of blockchain nodes
2. **Validator Security**: Enhanced protection for validator infrastructure
3. **Redundancy Planning**: Physical distribution of backup systems
4. **Hardware Security Modules**: Physical protection of HSMs
5. **Key Ceremony Security**: Physical controls for key generation events

Effective physical and environmental security controls address risks that are often overlooked in digital-focused organizations. By implementing appropriate physical protections, organizations can prevent attacks that bypass technical controls through physical access or tampering.
