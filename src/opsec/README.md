# Operational Security

Operational Security (OpSec) is a systematic approach to identifying critical information, determining threats to that information, analyzing vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing countermeasures to protect sensitive data and operations. This framework provides comprehensive guidance for implementing effective operational security practices in Web2 and Web3 environments.

## Core Components

This framework is organized into several interconnected components:

1. [Principles & Concepts](./principles/): Core principles and concepts of operational security
2. [Threat Modeling Overview](./threat-modeling-overview.md): Identifying and analyzing potential security threats
3. [Risk Management](./risk-management.md): Identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks
4. [Monitoring & Detection](./monitoring.md): Continuous monitoring of security events and anomalies
5. [Incident Response & Recovery](./incident-response-recovery.md): Handling security incidents when they occur
6. [Governance & Program Management](./governance-program-management.md): Establishing security leadership and organizational structures
7. [Control Domains](./control-domains.md): Key areas requiring specific security controls and practices
8. [Lifecycle](./lifecycle.md): The continuous process of implementing and maintaining security measures
9. [Continuous Improvement](./continuous-improvement-metrics.md): Learning from incidents and evolving security practices

## Web3 Relevance

While operational security principles apply broadly, this framework addresses specific considerations for Web3 organizations, including:

- Balancing decentralization with security controls
- Securing cryptocurrency operations and assets
- Managing the unique insider threats in distributed teams
- Implementing security in remote-first environments
- Addressing the public-facing nature of blockchain technologies

## Using This Framework

Organizations should adapt this framework to their specific needs, considering their size, resources, and risk profile. Start with the fundamentals and gradually implement more advanced controls as your security program matures.

The guidance provided here is designed to be practical and actionable, with specific recommendations that can be implemented by Web3 teams of all sizes.
