# Monitoring & Detection

Effective security monitoring and detection are critical components of operational security. This section outlines approaches to implement monitoring systems that can identify security threats and anomalies in real-time.

## Log Management & SIEM

Centralized logging and security information and event management (SIEM) systems provide visibility into security events across the organization.

### Key Components

1. **Log Collection**: Gathering logs from systems, applications, and network devices
2. **Log Normalization**: Standardizing log formats for consistent analysis
3. **Log Correlation**: Identifying relationships between events across different sources
4. **Log Retention**: Preserving logs for compliance and investigation purposes
5. **Security Analytics**: Analyzing logs to identify threats and anomalies

### Implementation Steps

1. Identify critical log sources based on security requirements
2. Implement centralized log collection infrastructure
3. Configure proper log retention periods based on policy and compliance
4. Implement log correlation and analysis capabilities
5. Establish log review procedures for security events
6. Ensure logs include appropriate detail without capturing sensitive data

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Blockchain Logs**: Monitoring blockchain events and transactions
2. **Smart Contract Events**: Capturing and analyzing events emitted by contracts
3. **Node Operation Logs**: Monitoring blockchain node performance and security
4. **Gas Usage Anomalies**: Detecting unusual transaction fee patterns
5. **Bridge Activity**: Monitoring cross-chain bridge operations for anomalies

## Alert Thresholds & Dashboards

Establishing appropriate alert thresholds and dashboards to effectively monitor security status and respond to incidents.

### Key Components

1. **Alert Thresholds**: Defining conditions that trigger security alerts
2. **Alert Prioritization**: Categorizing alerts based on severity and impact
3. **Alert Routing**: Directing alerts to appropriate personnel
4. **Security Dashboards**: Visual representations of security status
5. **Metric Tracking**: Monitoring key security performance indicators

### Implementation Steps

1. Define alert thresholds based on baseline activity and risk assessment
2. Implement alert prioritization to focus on the most critical issues
3. Establish alert routing procedures to ensure proper response
4. Create dashboards that provide actionable security insights
5. Regularly review and tune alert thresholds to reduce false positives
6. Develop procedures for escalating and responding to alerts

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Transaction Monitoring**: Alerting on unusual blockchain transactions
2. **Smart Contract Monitoring**: Detecting potential exploits or vulnerabilities
3. **Governance Monitoring**: Tracking governance proposals and voting
4. **Price Oracle Monitoring**: Detecting anomalies in price feed data
5. **Liquidity Monitoring**: Alerting on significant liquidity changes

## Threat Detection Approaches

Various approaches to detecting security threats through monitoring and analysis.

### Signature-Based Detection

Identifying known threat patterns based on signatures or indicators of compromise.

1. **Implementation**: Deploy solutions with threat intelligence feeds
2. **Strengths**: Effective against known threats with clear signatures
3. **Limitations**: Cannot detect novel or sophisticated attacks
4. **Best Practices**: Regularly update signature databases and threat intelligence

### Behavioral Detection

Identifying anomalies based on deviations from normal behavior patterns.

1. **Implementation**: Deploy solutions that establish baselines and detect deviations
2. **Strengths**: Can detect previously unknown threats and insider activities
3. **Limitations**: Requires tuning to reduce false positives
4. **Best Practices**: Establish accurate baselines during low-threat periods

### Heuristic Detection

Using rules and algorithms to identify suspicious activities based on behavior characteristics.

1. **Implementation**: Deploy solutions with customizable detection rules
2. **Strengths**: Balance between signature and behavioral approaches
3. **Limitations**: Requires ongoing rule refinement
4. **Best Practices**: Regularly review and update detection rules

### Threat Hunting

Proactively searching for threats that have evaded automated detection.

1. **Implementation**: Establish dedicated threat hunting capabilities
2. **Strengths**: Can identify sophisticated threats and APTs
3. **Limitations**: Resource-intensive and requires skilled personnel
4. **Best Practices**: Develop hypothesis-driven hunting processes

## Web3-Specific Monitoring

Specialized monitoring approaches for Web3 environments.

### On-Chain Monitoring

Monitoring blockchain transactions and smart contract interactions.

1. **Transaction Monitoring**: Tracking unusual transaction patterns
2. **Smart Contract Events**: Monitoring events emitted by contracts
3. **Token Transfers**: Tracking movement of tokens and assets
4. **Gas Usage Analysis**: Identifying unusual gas consumption patterns
5. **Governance Actions**: Monitoring governance proposals and votes

### Off-Chain Monitoring

Monitoring infrastructure, applications, and services supporting blockchain operations.

1. **Node Monitoring**: Tracking performance and security of blockchain nodes
2. **API Security Monitoring**: Detecting suspicious API usage
3. **Frontend Application Monitoring**: Identifying unusual user interactions
4. **Infrastructure Security Monitoring**: Tracking security events in supporting infrastructure
5. **Team Member Activity Monitoring**: Detecting unusual access or activities

Effective monitoring and detection enable organizations to identify security threats quickly, reducing the potential impact of security incidents. By implementing comprehensive monitoring across both traditional and Web3-specific environments, organizations can maintain visibility into their security posture and respond promptly to emerging threats.
