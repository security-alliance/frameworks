# {{ Title of this Page }}

Key Takeaway prompt: Without removing or modifying anything in the document, just after the heading, describe in a succint way (no more than 40 words), all the key points or tl;dr so that anyone can get a good grasp of the contents just by reading it. Don't add unnecessary sentences that sound like conclusions, like "By ensuring this..." "Doing all these...", "Having these security practinces...". Use the following format > 🔑 **Key Takeaway**:

[Context / Problem statement. In this first part, we introduce the topic, in no more than a few paragraphs. For example for Threat Modeling inside Operational Security Framework: "Effective security requires understanding **what you're protecting and who you're protecting it from**. Without a structured threat model, security efforts become unfocused and inefficient. Different entities face different threats based on their assets, visibility, and technological footprint." It can be this short, or it can have more context]

## Practical guidance

1. **Step-by-Step Actions** – numbered list users can follow.  
2. **Best-Practice Checklist** – bullet list they can literally tick.  
3. **Role-Based Tips** – highlight differences for Ops, HR, Dev, etc.  
(This mirrors OWASP Cheat Sheet brevity.)

## Why is it important

Explain consequences of ignoring this guidance and link to real incidents or CISA/NIST advisories supporting each risk.

## Implementation details

| Device Hardening | `../endpoint-security/...` |
| Network Segmentation | `../network-security/...` |

Cross-linking reduces duplication, following docs-as-code best practice.
