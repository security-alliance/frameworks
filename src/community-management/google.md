# Google Security
tag: [Community & Marketing, Security Specialist]

Google provides a wide range of services including email, file storage, search, and more. Protecting your Google account is one of the most crucial things to do, and Google offers multiple ways to enhance your account security. Here are five simple steps you can take right now to secure your Google account.

## Standard Security

### Configure 2FA

Properly configuring your two-factor authentication (2FA) settings is one of the most important steps you can take. Disable SMS 2FA and enable either an authenticator app or a hardware security key (preferred).

1. Go to [Google 2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification)
2. If “Voice or text message” is enabled, disable it
3. If you don’t have an Android device, configure an “Authenticator app” or “Security Key”. If you do, you can continue to use “Google prompts”
4. Store your backup codes in a safe place

### Remove Recovery Methods

Google uses heuristics for account recovery, but having your phone number as a recovery method can make it easier for attackers to steal your account after cloning your phone number. Email can also be a weak point if it is not properly secured.

1. Go to [Google Recovery Phone](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/rescuephone)
2. If a recovery phone is present, remove it
3. If this Google account is your primary account and you are confident you will not need to perform account recovery:
    1. Go to [Google Recovery Email](https://myaccount.google.com/recovery/email)
    2. If a recovery email is present, remove it

### Hide Personal Information

Ensure your personal information is not publicly visible, reducing the risk of attackers using it to impersonate you.

1. Go to [Google Profile](https://myaccount.google.com/profile)
2. For each item in your profile, check if it’s set to “Anyone”. Consider whether the information can be used by an attacker to impersonate you.
    - Set your birthday to private if it isn’t already

### Manage Active Sessions

Review your active sessions to ensure you’re not logged in anywhere unexpectedly.

1. Go to [Google Device Activity](https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity)
2. If there are any sessions you don’t recognize, terminate them

### Manage OAuth Applications

OAuth connections can sometimes request extensive permissions, such as full access to your inbox or files. Review and manage these applications.

1. Go to [Google Connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections)
2. For each app or service, click on it to review its permissions. If you’re not using it or the permissions are excessive, remove its access to your Google account


## Extended Security

Login to Gmail, and in the top right click your account profile picture and go to "Manage Your Google Account":

1.) Go to the security tab on the left-hand side and then scroll down until you see "Your connect to third-party apps & Services". From here, revoke all applications that should not be connected.
2.) Go to Security on the left-hand side > scroll down > ‘Log out of all unknown devices’ and then right below that, turn off “skip password when possible”
3.) Still on Security, go to “How you sign in with Google” and setup your 2FA or Security Key in this section
4.) Ensure you do not have a recovery phone setup. No SMS 2FA or phone number on your account at all.

Once these steps are completed, please change your password. (remember to note down your backup codes)

If using Google Authenticator as a 2FA authenticator app on your phone, disconnect it from the cloud, as backup codes are then stored in the google cloud associated to email. Use it without an account and ensure backup codes are written down offline.

### Advanced Protection Program

If you’re a public figure or influencer, you may want to enroll in the Advanced Protection Program for enhanced security measures. This program enforces the use of security keys, blocks unverified apps, and makes account recovery more difficult.

1. Go to [Google Advanced Protection Program](https://myaccount.google.com/advanced-protection/landing)
2. Complete the steps to enroll in the program
