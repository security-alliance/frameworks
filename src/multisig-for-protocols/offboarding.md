# Offboarding

When leaving a multisig, follow these steps:

## Signer removal

1. **Coordinate with team** - Notify other signers and schedule the removal transaction
2. **Execute removal** - Follow standard signer rotation procedures ([Section 2.3](./general-rules.md#signer-rotation))
3. **Verify removal** - Confirm your address has been removed from the multisig
4. **Update documentation** - Ensure documentation reflects the change

## Clean up access

- Leave all multisig communication channels (Signal, Telegram, etc.)
- Remove access to any sensitive shared documents or resources
- Delete any locally stored sensitive multisig information

## Handover

- Share any relevant context or pending items with remaining signers
- Provide contact information if needed for transition questions
