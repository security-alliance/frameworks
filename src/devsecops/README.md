# DevSecOps
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist, Devops, SRE]

Traditionally, rapid development and deployment is often prioritized at the expense of security considerations. This is generally speaking no different in web3, but it is important to take integrity, confidentiality, and availability into consideration too. To effectively address this without compromising on rapid development and deployment, it is essential to integrate security into the process, which is where devsecops comes into play. By implementing devsecops, projects can not only deploy faster, but also be more secure.

When operating in a devsecops mindset, projects prioritizes automation and collaboration between the development, operations and security teams.

Some of the key areas to consider are:
1. Integrate security measures early in the development process, such as by utilizing security tools such as fuzzing, static and dynamic analysis tools in your CI/CD process, to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities before they turn into critical issues.
2. Implement automated security testing and monitoring.
3. Development, Operations and Security teams should be aligned and work closely together.
