# Security Testing
tag: [Engineer/Developer, Security Specialist, Devops, SRE]

Security testing is a crucial part of the DevSecOps process, as it helps identify vulnerabilities early on so that they can be taken care of before they become an issue in production.

1. Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to analyze source code for vulnerabilities.
2. Use DAST tools to test running applications for security issues.
3. Combine SAST and DAST approaches with IAST tools for comprehensive security testing.
4. Implement fuzz testing to discover security vulnerabilities by inputting random data.
