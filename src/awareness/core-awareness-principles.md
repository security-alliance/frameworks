# 1. Core Awareness Principles

## Key concepts

- **Threat Recognition**
Understand that threats come in various forms—phishing, social engineering, malware, and insider risks. For instance, a social media message urging immediate action might be a scam designed to exploit urgency.

- **Risk Perception**
Assessing risk means evaluating both the likelihood of an attack and the potential impact. For example, if you frequently receive messages from unknown sources on a platform like Twitter, you should view these interactions with increased skepticism.

- **Zero Trust Mindset**
Always verify before trusting. Even messages from familiar contacts should be confirmed if they involve unexpected requests or sensitive information.

- **Filtering Credible Information**
In an era of information overload, it's critical to identify and rely on reputable sources. This means following established security blogs, official alerts from cybersecurity agencies, or verified community channels.

> **Real-World Example**
A company might receive a seemingly routine email from a "vendor" requesting updated banking details. An employee with a strong zero trust mindset will independently verify the request through known contact numbers or an established internal process, thereby avoiding a potential fraud.
