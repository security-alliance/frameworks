## Frameworks PR Checklist

Thank you for contributing to the Security Frameworks! Before you open a PR, make sure to read [information for contributors](https://framework.securityalliance.org/book/contribute/contribute.html) and take a look at the following checklist:

- [ ] Describe your changes, substitute this text with the information
- [ ] If you are touching an existing piece of content, tag current contributors from the attribution list
- [ ] If there is a steward for that framework, ask the steward to review it
- [ ] If you're modifying the general outline, make sure to use `src/config/SUMMARY.develop` and not `src/SUMMARY.md`
- [ ] If you need feedback for your content from the wider community, share the PR in our Discord
- [ ] Review changes to ensure there are no typos, see instructions below
