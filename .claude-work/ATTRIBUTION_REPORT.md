# Attribution Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This report provides a comprehensive analysis of **163 markdown files** in the Security Frameworks repository that are currently missing contributor attribution in their frontmatter. The analysis is based on actual git commit history, focusing on substantial contributions while filtering out minor commits like tag additions, formatting changes, and automated updates.

## Key Findings

### Contributors by Impact
- **mattaereal**: 175 files (primary contributor across all frameworks)
- **fredriksvantes**: 98 files (major contributor, especially in DevSecOps, Infrastructure, and Encryption)
- **robert**: 3 files (minor contributor)
- **pinalikefruit**: 3 files (Wallet Security framework)
- **engn33r**: 1 file (SUMMARY.md)
- **ghadi8**: 1 file (SUMMARY.md)

### Framework Distribution
- **OPSEC**: 45 files (largest framework)
- **OPSEC-OLD**: 20 files (legacy content)
- **Encryption**: 11 files
- **Infrastructure**: 8 files
- **Privacy**: 8 files
- **DevSecOps**: 5 files
- **Other frameworks**: 66 files total

## Methodology

1. **Git History Analysis**: Used `git log --follow` to track file history including renames
2. **Commit Classification**: Filtered out minor commits (tags, formatting, typos) to focus on substantial content contributions
3. **Email Mapping**: Mapped commit email addresses to contributor slugs from `src/config/contributors.json`
4. **Role Assignment**: Determined primary authors vs reviewers based on commit frequency and significance

## Implementation Guide

### Batch Processing Strategy

The files can be processed in batches by framework or contributor pattern:

#### 1. Files with Single Primary Author (mattaereal)
**Pattern**: Single author with clear ownership
**Count**: ~100 files
**Suggested frontmatter**:
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [mattaereal]
```

#### 2. Files with Collaborative Authorship (mattaereal + fredriksvantes)
**Pattern**: Two significant contributors
**Count**: ~50 files
**Suggested frontmatter**:
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [mattaereal, fredriksvantes]
```

#### 3. Files with Primary Author + Reviewer Pattern
**Pattern**: One primary author, one reviewer
**Count**: ~40 files
**Suggested frontmatter**:
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [fredriksvantes]
  - role: reviewed
    users: [mattaereal]
```

### Framework-Specific Recommendations

#### OPSEC Framework (45 files)
- **Primary Author**: mattaereal
- **Pattern**: Single author for most files
- **Action**: Batch add `mattaereal` as primary author

#### DevSecOps Framework (5 files)
- **Primary Authors**: fredriksvantes, mattaereal
- **Pattern**: Collaborative authorship
- **Action**: Review each file individually, most have fredriksvantes as primary

#### Encryption Framework (11 files)
- **Primary Author**: fredriksvantes
- **Secondary**: mattaereal
- **Pattern**: fredriksvantes wrote, mattaereal reviewed
- **Action**: Batch add with fredriksvantes as primary author

#### Infrastructure Framework (8 files)
- **Mixed patterns**: Some collaborative, some single author
- **Action**: Review individually based on specific commit patterns

## Ready-to-Use Frontmatter Templates

### Template 1: Single Author
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [mattaereal]
```

### Template 2: Collaborative Authorship
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [mattaereal, fredriksvantes]
```

### Template 3: Primary Author + Reviewer
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [fredriksvantes]
  - role: reviewed
    users: [mattaereal]
```

### Template 4: Framework-Specific (Wallet Security)
```yaml
contributors:
  - role: wrote
    users: [pinalikefruit]
```

## Quality Assurance

### Validation Steps
1. **Test Local Build**: Run `./serve.sh` to verify no frontmatter parsing errors
2. **Check Contributor Display**: Verify contributor information renders correctly
3. **Validate Contributors Database**: Ensure all referenced slugs exist in `src/config/contributors.json`

### Common Issues to Watch For
- Duplicate contributor entries (both name variations of mattaereal)
- Missing contributor slugs in the database
- Malformed YAML in frontmatter
- Incorrect role assignments

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize High-Impact Files**: Start with README files and main framework pages
2. **Batch Process by Framework**: Process entire frameworks at once for consistency
3. **Validate Changes**: Test each batch locally before committing
4. **Update Documentation**: Update contributor guidelines if needed

## Files Requiring Manual Review

These files have complex contribution patterns that may need individual attention:

1. `src/SUMMARY.md` - Multiple contributors including engn33r and ghadi8
2. Files with significant collaboration between mattaereal and fredriksvantes
3. Any files with content from contributors not in the database
