sections in a document.\n\nPlease consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.\n\n## Install\nInstall with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n```sh\n$ npm install --save section-matter\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n**Params**\n\n* `input` **{String|Buffer|Object}**: If input is an object, it's `content` property must be a string or buffer.    \n* **{Object}**: options    \n* `returns` **{Object}**: Returns an object with a `content` string and an array of `sections` objects.  \n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar sections = require('{%= name %}');\nvar result = sections(input, options);\n// { content: 'Content before sections', sections: [] }\n```\n\nSee available [options](#options).\n\n## Example\n\n_With the exception of front-matter, **which must be the very first thing in the string**, the opening delimiter of all other sections must be followed by a string to be used as the `key` for the section._\n\nGiven the following string:\n\n```\nContent before the sections.\n\n---\n\nMore content.\n\n---one\ntitle: One\n---\n\nThis is the first section.\n```\n\nThe following code:\n\n```js\nconsole.log(sections(input));\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n```js\n{ \n  content: 'Content before the sections.\\n\\n---\\n\\nMore content.\\n',\n  sections: [\n    { \n      key: 'one',\n      data: 'title: One',\n      content: '\\nThis is the first section.' \n    } \n  ] \n}\n```\n\n## Options\n\n### options.section_parse\n\n**Type**: `function`\n\n**Default**: `undefined`\n\nFunction to be called on each section after it's parsed from the string.\n\n**Example**\n\nGiven the following string (`foo.md`):\n\n```\nThis is content before the sections.\n\n---one\ntitle: First section\n---\n\nThis is section one.\n\n---two\ntitle: Second section\n---\n\nThis is section two.\n```\n\nUsing the following custom `section_parse` function:\n\n```js\nvar fs = require('fs');\nvar path = require('path');\nvar yaml = require('js-yaml');\nvar sections = require('section-matter');\n\nvar str = fs.readFileSync('foo.md');\nvar options = {\n  section_parse: function(section) {\n    console.log(section)\n    section.key = 'section-' + section.key;\n    section.data = yaml.safeLoad(section.data);\n  }\n};\n\nvar result = sections(str, options);\nconsole.log(result);\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n```js\n{\n  content: 'This is content before the sections.\\n',\n  sections: [\n    {\n      key: 'section-one',\n      data: { title: 'First section' },\n      content: '\\nThis is section one.\\n'\n    },\n    {\n      key: 'section-two',\n      data: { title: 'Second section' },\n      content: '\\nThis is section two.\\n'\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### options.section_delimiter\n\n**Type**: `string`\n\n**Default**: `---`\n\nDelimiter to use as the separator for sections. _With the exception of front-matter, which must be the very first thing in the string, the opening delimiter of all other sections must be followed by a string to be used as the `key` for the section._\n\n**Example**\n\n```js\nvar input = '~~~\\ntitle: bar\\n~~~\\n\\nfoo\\n~~~one\\ntitle: One\\n~~~\\nThis is one';\nconsole.log(sections(input, {section_delimiter: '~~~'}));\n```\n\nResults in:\n\n```js\n{\n  content: '',\n  sections: [\n    {\n      key: '',\n      data: 'title: bar',\n      content: '\\nfoo'\n    },\n    {\n      key: 'one',\n      data: 'title: One',\n      content: 'This is one'\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## About\n<details>\n
