**Welcome to the official repository for Security Frameworks**—a curated collection of structured, community-driven security best practices maintained by the Security Alliance (SEAL). This repository powers a comprehensive, evolving security reference resource designed for practitioners and organizations to adopt, adapt, and contribute to.

> ⚠️ **This is a work in progress.**  
> The Security Frameworks are continuously evolving as we add, refine, and review content.  
> *Check out our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/scode2277/verceltry/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how you can help shape this resource — whether by fixing typos, suggesting improvements, or contributing new sections.*

## What Are the Security Frameworks?

The Security Frameworks are a **modular taxonomy of security topics**—ranging from operations and incident response to community management and general security awereness.

They serve as:

- A **collection of best practices** written in a general and technology-agnostic way, applicable across different contexts.
- A **reference guide** to help secure Web3 projects and build resilience against threats, from basic considerations to complex scenarios.
- A **well-organized compilation** of security insights, designed to centralize existing knowledge while also providing new, practical guidance where gaps exist.
- A **living resource** that evolves with community contributions and feedback.

Unlike typical blog posts or curated lists, this framework emphasizes **fundamental security principles and practical applications** rather than chasing the latest trends. It’s not meant to be read linearly, but rather used as a reference tool.

## Why We Created the Security Frameworks

Security challenges in Web3 are expanding—many of them not limited to blockchain infrastructure itself but affecting the broader ecosystem. While information is abundant, it is often fragmented, inconsistent, or hard to access.

We created this resource to:

- **Centralize knowledge** scattered across the internet into one accessible reference.
- **Fill in the gaps** by generating new content where existing resources fall short.
- **Support practitioners** with in-depth, actionable guidance instead of surface-level commentary.
- **Promote resilience** by focusing on principles that remain relevant across technologies, not just the “latest and greatest.”

## Who Can Benefit

This resource is open to **everyone**:

- Web3 teams seeking security best practices throughout their project lifecycle.
- Web2 professionals looking to understand blockchain security fundamentals.
- Community managers, policy writers, incident responders, and anyone shaping secure digital ecosystems.

Think of it as a **one-stop shop for Web3 security**: a high-level framework that combines structured knowledge with practical advice to help teams and individuals level up their security capabilities.

## Live Resources

The Security Frameworks are published online in two versions:

- **Main**  – [Website following `main` branch](https://frameworks.securityalliance.org)
    - Contains **polished, reviewed, and production-ready content**.
- **Develop** – [Website following `develop` branch](https://frameworks.securityalliance.dev)
    - Contains **work-in-progress material**, drafts, and experimental updates.

Both versions are continuously updated, but only `main` reflects finalized, community-reviewed guidance.
