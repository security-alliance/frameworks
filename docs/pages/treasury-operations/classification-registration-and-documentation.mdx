# Custodial Treasury Security: Inventory & Controls Framework

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Proper documentation and classification of custodial accounts is essential for institutional treasury security. This guide covers the security assessment, classification, and control frameworks for crypto assets held with third-party custodians.

## Classification Process

Use this dual classification to determine appropriate security controls for each custodial account.

### Step 1: Impact Assessment

Evaluate the consequences if this account is compromised or unavailable.

#### Financial Impact

Calculate the total value at risk in this account:

- Current market value of all assets held
- Include value of any active positions (e.g., staked assets, DeFi deposits)
- What is the financial impact if unavailable for 7 days?

#### Operational Impact

Assess the consequences if this account becomes unavailable:

- What specific operations require this account?
- Do you have a secondary custody account that can handle these operations?
- What is the reputational impact if this account is compromised or unavailable?

#### Regulatory Impact

Evaluate regulatory and compliance consequences:

- Are assets in this account subject to regulatory reporting requirements (SEC filings, audit requirements)?
- Does this account hold regulated assets (e.g., stablecoins subject to reserves reporting)?
- What are the regulatory deadlines that could be missed if this account is unavailable?

#### Impact Classification

| Level        | Financial Exposure (% of Total Assets) | Operational Dependency                       | Regulatory Impact                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**      | \<1%                                   | No critical operations depend on it          | No regulatory reporting tied to this account         |
| **Medium**   | 1% - 10%                               | Important but alternative funding available  | Periodic reporting; delays manageable                |
| **High**     | 10% - 25%                              | Critical operations, limited alternatives    | Regular regulatory filings; delays cause violations  |
| **Critical** | \>25%                                  | Business-critical, no alternatives for weeks | Real-time reporting requirements; SEC filings; audit |

### Step 2: Operational Assessment

Evaluate how frequently and urgently this account must be accessed.

#### Transaction Frequency

Document typical transaction patterns:

- Transactions per month
- Typical transaction sizes
- Predictability of transaction timing

#### Access Urgency

Define response time requirements:

- What is the maximum acceptable delay for routine transactions?
- Are there scenarios requiring same-day execution?
- What are the consequences of 24-hour, 72-hour, or 7-day delays?

#### Coordination Requirements

Assess how transactions are executed:

- How many approvers are needed for typical transactions?
- Are transactions handled manually or through automated systems?
- Do approvers need to coordinate across timezones?

Note: Single-approver configurations should only be used for low-value operational accounts (\<0.1%) with additional compensating controls like strict spending limits and daily reconciliation.

#### Operational Classification

| Type                  | Frequency     | Response Window | Example Use Cases                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold Vault**        | \<5 tx/month  | 48-72 hours     | Long-term reserves, infrequent rebalancing         |
| **Warm Storage**      | 5-50 tx/month | 4-24 hours      | Scheduled payments, planned operations             |
| **Active Operations** | \>50 tx/month | \<4 hours       | Trading capital, frequent operational expenses     |
| **Time-Critical**     | Unpredictable | \<2 hours       | Collateral management, market-sensitive operations |

### Step 3: Security Control Matrix

Combine impact and operational assessments to determine required controls.

| Use Case                      | Impact      | Operational   | Approvers | MFA Requirement    | Whitelist Delay | Additional Controls                         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Primary Reserve (>25% assets) | Critical    | Cold Vault    | 5-7       | Hardware mandatory | 72 hours        | Geographic distribution, MPC recommended    |
| Secondary Reserve (10-25%)    | Critical    | Cold Vault    | 4-5       | Hardware mandatory | 48 hours        | Geographic distribution, MPC recommended    |
| Active Treasury (5-10%)       | High        | Warm Storage  | 3-4       | Hardware mandatory | 24 hours        | Daily reconciliation, velocity limits       |
| Trading Capital (variable)    | High        | Active Ops    | 3         | Hardware mandatory | None            | Real-time monitoring, simulation required   |
| Trading Capital               | High        | Active Ops    | 3         | Hardware mandatory | None            | Real-time monitoring, simulation required   |
| DeFi Positions                | Medium-High | Warm Storage  | 3         | Hardware mandatory | 24 hours        | Contract whitelist, position monitoring     |
| Liquidation Protection        | Medium-High | Time-Critical | 2         | Hardware required  | None            | Pre-approved destinations, automated alerts |
| Operational Wallet            | Medium      | Active Ops    | 2         | Hardware required  | 12 hours        | Daily caps, weekly audit                    |
| Payments                      | Low         | Active Ops    | 2         | Standard TOTP      | 6 hours         | Per-tx cap, monthly aggregate limit         |

### Step 4: Enhanced Controls for High-Risk Accounts

For Critical and High impact accounts, implement additional security layers beyond the baseline controls.

#### Transaction Verification

- Test transactions: Send maximum $100 to new addresses before executing full transaction
- Multi-channel confirmation: Request via one channel, approve via separate channel
- Simulation requirement: All transactions must be simulated before execution
- Address verification: Verify new addresses against three independent sources

For DeFi interactions: refer to the [DeFi Risk Assessment Guide](https://entethalliance.org/specs/defi-risks/v1/) for recommended procedures.


#### Access Security

- Hardware security keys (FIDO2/WebAuthn) mandatory for all approvers
  - Secure fallback: Each approver must register minimum 2 hardware keys stored in separate secure locations
  - Key loss procedure: Temporary access via backup key + additional approver verification via multiple channels + mandatory key replacement within 48 hours
- IP whitelisting with 24-hour change approval delay
- Device fingerprinting with new device approval process
- Session timeout and re-authentication for sensitive operations
- Dedicated credentials: Use separate email addresses and passwords exclusively for custody access, not shared with other corporate systems

#### Device Security

- Dedicated secure workstations for custody access only
- Network isolation on separate VLAN/segment
- VPN mandatory for all platform access
- Full disk encryption with automatic screen lock
- MDM-enforced security baseline with remote wipe capability

#### MPC for Large Holdings

For organizations managing >10% of total assets or >$10M equivalent in a single custodial account consider using MPC:

- Evaluate MPC (Multi-Party Computation) custody solutions that distribute key material across multiple parties
- Consider threshold signature schemes (e.g., 3-of-5 or 5-of-9) where no single party controls sufficient key shares
- Implement geographic distribution of key share holders across multiple jurisdictions
- Establish clear key refresh and rotation procedures
- Document recovery procedures and test annually

#### Zero Trust Architecture Alternative

A Zero Trust architecture involves continuous verification of user, device, and context, rather than reliance on a single perimeter or network location. Centralizing access through a secure environment (such as a bastion host or isolated cloud workspace) can support Zero Trust principles when combined with strong identity and device posture enforcement.

- **Bastion Host Approach:** Deploy a hardened jump server that acts as the sole gateway to custody platforms.
  - All custody sessions route through the bastion with full session recording
  - Bastion enforces MFA, device posture checks, and approved software versions
  - No direct custody access from employee devices
  - Centralized patch management and security configuration
  
- **Cloud Workspace Isolation:** Use browser-isolated or virtual workspace environments (e.g., Citrix, AWS WorkSpaces, Azure Virtual Desktop)
  - Custody access occurs only within a controlled virtual environment
  - Copy/paste and download restrictions prevent data exfiltration
  - Session timeout and automatic workspace destruction after use
  - Significantly reduces risk from compromised employee devices

#### Security Monitoring & Logging

For Critical and High impact accounts, implement centralized security monitoring:

- **SIEM Deployment:** Deploy SIEM to centralize logs from custody platforms, authentication systems, and access devices. Create real-time correlation rules for suspicious patterns (failed authentication, geographic anomalies, policy changes).

- **Internal Incident Response:** Build dedicated incident response capability for custody-related security events. Define clear escalation procedures, maintain 24/7 on-call rotation for Critical accounts, and establish playbooks for custody compromise scenarios.

- **Essential Log Sources:** Authentication events, transaction attempts, policy modifications, access changes, whitelist updates, IP address changes, new device enrollments, and approval workflows.

For Medium and Low impact accounts, leverage custodian's native audit logs with weekly manual review and automated alerting for critical events (new device enrollment, policy changes, transactions above threshold).
