# Custodial Treasury Security: Classification Framework

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Proper documentation and classification of custodial accounts is essential for institutional treasury security. This
guide focuses on the security assessment and classification framework for crypto assets held with third-party
custodians.

## Classification Process

Use this dual classification to determine appropriate security controls for each custodial account.

### Step 1: Impact Assessment

Evaluate the consequences if this account is compromised or unavailable.

#### Financial Impact

Calculate the total value at risk in this account:

- Current market value of all assets held
- Include value of any active positions (e.g., staked assets, DeFi deposits)
- What is the financial impact if unavailable for 7 days?

#### Operational Impact

Assess the consequences if this account becomes unavailable:

- What specific operations require this account?
- Do you have a secondary custody account that can handle these operations?
- What is the reputational impact if this account is compromised or unavailable?

#### Regulatory Impact

Evaluate regulatory and compliance consequences:

- Are assets in this account subject to regulatory reporting requirements (SEC filings, audit requirements)?
- Does this account hold regulated assets (e.g., stablecoins subject to reserves reporting)?
- What are the regulatory deadlines that could be missed if this account is unavailable?

#### Impact Classification

| Level        | Financial Exposure (% of Total Assets) | Operational Dependency                       | Regulatory Impact                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Low**      | \<1%                                   | No critical operations depend on it          | No regulatory reporting tied to this account         |
| **Medium**   | 1% - 10%                               | Important but alternative funding available  | Periodic reporting; delays manageable                |
| **High**     | 10% - 25%                              | Critical operations, limited alternatives    | Regular regulatory filings; delays cause violations  |
| **Critical** | \>25%                                  | Business-critical, no alternatives for weeks | Real-time reporting requirements; SEC filings; audit |

### Step 2: Operational Assessment

Evaluate how frequently and urgently this account must be accessed.

#### Transaction Frequency

Document typical transaction patterns:

- Transactions per month
- Typical transaction sizes
- Predictability of transaction timing

#### Access Urgency

Define response time requirements:

- What is the maximum acceptable delay for routine transactions?
- Are there scenarios requiring same-day execution?
- What are the consequences of 24-hour, 72-hour, or 7-day delays?

#### Coordination Requirements

Assess how transactions are executed:

- How many approvers are needed for typical transactions?
- Are transactions handled manually or through automated systems?
- Do approvers need to coordinate across timezones?

Note: Single-approver configurations should only be used for low-value operational accounts (\<0.1%) with additional
compensating controls like strict spending limits and daily reconciliation.

#### Operational Classification

| Type                  | Frequency     | Response Window | Example Use Cases                                  |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cold Vault**        | \<5 tx/month  | 48-72 hours     | Long-term reserves, infrequent rebalancing         |
| **Warm Storage**      | 5-50 tx/month | 4-24 hours      | Scheduled payments, planned operations             |
| **Active Operations** | \>50 tx/month | \<4 hours       | Trading capital, frequent operational expenses     |
| **Time-Critical**     | Unpredictable | \<2 hours       | Collateral management, market-sensitive operations |

### Step 3: Security Control Matrix

Combine impact and operational assessments to determine required controls.

| Use Case | Impact | Operational | Approvers | MFA Requirement | Whitelist Delay | Additional Controls |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Payments | Low | Active Ops | 2 | Standard TOTP | 6 hours | **Baseline (all accounts):** Dedicated devices for custody access, address whitelisting enabled, test small amount to new addresses before full transaction, transaction simulation. **Low-specific:** Per-transaction cap, monthly aggregate limit |
| Operational Wallet | Medium | Active Ops | 2 | Hardware required | 12 hours | All Low controls + daily transaction caps, weekly reconciliation, monthly audit |
| Liquidation Protection | Medium-High | Time-Critical | 2 | Hardware required | None | All Low/Medium controls + automated alerts for position health, real-time monitoring |
| DeFi Positions | Medium-High | Warm Storage | 3 | Hardware mandatory | 24 hours | All Low/Medium controls + smart contract whitelist, position monitoring, daily reconciliation |
| Trading Capital (variable) | High | Active Ops | 3 | Hardware mandatory | 6 hours | All Low/Medium controls + smart contract whitelist, real-time monitoring, daily reconciliation |
| Active Treasury (5-10%) | High | Warm Storage | 3-4 | Hardware mandatory | 24 hours | All Low/Medium controls + transaction velocity limits, SIEM monitoring, multi-channel confirmation |
| Secondary Reserve (10-25%) | Critical | Cold Vault | 4-5 | Hardware mandatory | 48 hours | All Low/Medium/High controls + geographic distribution of approvers, MPC recommended |
| Primary Reserve (>25% assets) | Critical | Cold Vault | 5-7 | Hardware mandatory | 72 hours | All Low/Medium/High controls + geographic distribution of approvers, MPC recommended |

### Step 4: Document Your Decision

- Record impact level and operational type with justification
- Capture approver thresholds and required controls
- Store links to relevant custody accounts and addresses
