# Control Domains

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Operational security controls are organized into domains that address different aspects of security. This section provides an overview of these domains and how they work together to create a comprehensive security posture.

## Introduction to Control Domains

Security controls are safeguards or countermeasures designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information and systems. Organizing these controls into domains helps ensure comprehensive coverage across different aspects of security.

The primary control domains in operational security are:

1. **Organizational Controls**: Policies, governance, and management structures
2. **People & Personnel Controls**: Security measures related to human behavior and awareness
3. **Physical & Environmental Controls**: Protection of physical assets and environments
4. **Technical & Digital Controls**: Security measures for systems, networks, and data

## Implementing a Balanced Control Framework

Effective operational security requires a balanced approach across all control domains:

1. **Layered Defense**: Implement controls across multiple domains to create defense in depth
2. **Risk-Based Approach**: Allocate resources based on risk assessment rather than implementing all possible controls
3. **Continuous Evaluation**: Regularly assess the effectiveness of controls against evolving threats
4. **Adaptability**: Adjust controls based on changes in technology, threats, and organizational needs

  - [Secure Workspace & Travel](/opsec/control-domains/physical-environmental/secure-workspace-travel)
  - [Tamper Evidence](/opsec/control-domains/physical-environmental/tamper-evidence)
- [Technical Controls](/opsec/control-domains/technical) — hardening infrastructure, endpoints, and communication.
  - [Cryptocurrency Controls](/opsec/control-domains/technical/cryptocurrency-controls)
  - [Device Hardening](/opsec/control-domains/technical/device-hardening)
  - [Encrypted Storage & Backups](/opsec/control-domains/technical/encrypted-storage-backups)
  - [Network & Communication Security](/opsec/control-domains/technical/network-communication-security)
  - [Two-Factor & Hardware Auth](/opsec/control-domains/technical/two-factor-hardware-auth)

## Control Selection and Implementation

When selecting and implementing controls:

1. **Identify Requirements**: Determine what needs to be protected and why
2. **Assess Current State**: Evaluate existing controls and identify gaps
3. **Select Appropriate Controls**: Choose controls based on risk assessment and organizational context
4. **Implement Systematically**: Deploy controls in a coordinated manner
5. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Regularly evaluate how well controls are working
6. **Improve Continuously**: Refine and enhance controls based on performance and changing needs

## Web3-Specific Considerations

In Web3 environments, control implementation must address unique challenges:

1. **Decentralized Operations**: Implementing controls across distributed teams and systems
2. **Cryptocurrency Security**: Specialized controls for digital asset protection
3. **Smart Contract Security**: Controls specific to blockchain-based code
4. **Community Governance**: Balancing centralized security controls with decentralized governance

The following sections detail the specific controls within each domain, providing guidance on implementation and best practices tailored to Web3 organizations.
