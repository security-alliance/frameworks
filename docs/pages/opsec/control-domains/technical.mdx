# Technical & Digital Controls

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Technical controls form the backbone of operational security, protecting systems, networks, and data from digital threats. This section outlines key technical controls that should be implemented as part of a comprehensive security program.

## Device Hardening

Securing devices by minimizing attack surfaces and implementing defensive configurations.

### Key Components

1. **Secure Configuration Baselines**: Standardized secure configurations for different device types
2. **Endpoint Protection**: Anti-malware, application control, and other protective tools
3. **OS Hardening**: Removing unnecessary services and securing operating systems
4. **Patch Management**: Keeping systems updated with security patches
5. **Local Firewall**: Controlling network connections at the device level

### Implementation Steps

1. Develop secure configuration baselines for each device type
2. Implement endpoint protection solutions on all devices
3. Remove or disable unnecessary services, applications, and features
4. Establish an effective patch management process
5. Configure local firewalls with appropriate rules
6. Regularly scan for compliance with security baselines

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Development Environments**: Securing environments used for smart contract development
2. **Cold Storage Systems**: Hardening systems used for cryptocurrency key management
3. **Transaction Signing Devices**: Enhanced security for devices used to sign transactions
4. **Node Operation**: Specialized hardening for blockchain node infrastructure
5. **Testing Environments**: Securing environments used for contract testing and simulation

## Network & Communication Security

Protecting data in transit and securing network infrastructure against attacks.

### Key Components

1. **Network Segmentation**: Dividing networks into security zones
2. **Encrypted Communications**: Protecting data transmitted over networks
3. **Secure Remote Access**: VPN and other secure access solutions
4. **Network Monitoring**: Detecting suspicious network activity
5. **Perimeter Security**: Firewalls, intrusion prevention, and other boundary protections

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement network segmentation based on security requirements
2. Deploy encryption for all sensitive communications
3. Establish secure remote access solutions with strong authentication
4. Implement network monitoring and traffic analysis
5. Deploy and properly configure perimeter security controls
6. Regularly test network security through vulnerability assessments and penetration testing

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Node Communication**: Securing blockchain node communications
2. **API Security**: Protecting interfaces to blockchain services
3. **RPC Endpoint Protection**: Securing remote procedure call endpoints
4. **P2P Network Security**: Addressing risks in peer-to-peer networks
5. **MEV Protection**: Mitigating risks related to maximal extractable value

## Encrypted Storage & Backups

Protecting data at rest through encryption and secure backup strategies.

### Key Components

1. **Full-Disk Encryption**: Encrypting entire storage devices
2. **File-Level Encryption**: Protecting individual sensitive files
3. **Key Management**: Securely managing encryption keys
4. **Secure Backups**: Protecting backup data through encryption and access controls
5. **Recovery Testing**: Verifying the ability to restore from backups

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement full-disk encryption on all devices storing sensitive data
2. Deploy file-level encryption for particularly sensitive information
3. Establish secure key management processes with appropriate access controls
4. Implement encrypted and access-controlled backup solutions
5. Regularly test backup recovery processes
6. Store backup media securely with appropriate physical protections

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Seed Phrase Backups**: Secure storage of wallet recovery information
2. **Multi-Location Backups**: Distributing backup data to prevent single points of failure
3. **Cold Storage Backups**: Offline backup strategies for critical keys
4. **Smart Contract Backups**: Preserving contract source code and deployment parameters
5. **Social Recovery Options**: Implementing secure social recovery systems for critical keys

## Two-Factor & Hardware Authentication

Strengthening authentication through multiple factors and hardware-based solutions.

### Key Components

1. **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Requiring multiple verification methods
2. **Hardware Security Keys**: Physical devices for authentication
3. **Biometric Authentication**: Using biological characteristics for verification
4. **Time-Based One-Time Passwords**: Temporary codes for authentication
5. **Single Sign-On Integration**: Centralizing and securing authentication

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement multi-factor authentication for all access to sensitive systems
2. Deploy hardware security keys for high-value accounts and systems
3. Establish backup authentication methods and recovery processes
4. Integrate MFA with single sign-on solutions where appropriate
5. Train users on proper use of authentication tools
6. Regularly audit authentication configurations and access

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Hardware Wallets**: Using dedicated devices for cryptocurrency transactions
2. **Multi-Signature Setups**: Requiring multiple approvals for critical transactions
3. **Air-Gapped Signing**: Using offline devices for transaction signing
4. **Social Recovery**: Implementing secure key recovery through trusted contacts
5. **DApp Authentication**: Securing connections to decentralized applications

## Cryptocurrency-Specific Controls

Technical controls specifically designed to address the unique security challenges of cryptocurrency operations.

### Key Components

1. **Wallet Security**: Technical measures to secure cryptocurrency wallets
2. **Transaction Verification**: Processes to verify transaction details before signing
3. **Key Management**: Secure generation, storage, and use of cryptographic keys
4. **Blockchain Monitoring**: Tracking on-chain activity for anomalies
5. **Smart Contract Security**: Technical controls for secure contract interaction

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement appropriate wallet solutions based on security requirements
2. Establish transaction verification procedures with multiple checks
3. Deploy secure key management practices and technologies
4. Implement monitoring for blockchain transactions and activities
5. Develop secure processes for smart contract interaction
6. Regularly review and update cryptocurrency security controls

### Web3-Specific Best Practices

1. **Cold Storage**: Using offline systems for storing significant assets
2. **Multi-Signature Wallets**: Requiring multiple approvals for transactions
3. **Transaction Simulation**: Testing transactions before execution
4. **Gas Limit Setting**: Controlling transaction costs and preventing attacks
5. **Contract Interaction Verification**: Verifying contract behavior before approval

Effective technical and digital controls provide a strong foundation for operational security. By implementing comprehensive device, network, data, and authentication protections, organizations can significantly reduce their attack surface and better protect their digital assets.
