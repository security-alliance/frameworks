# People & Personnel Controls

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

People are both the greatest asset and potentially the greatest vulnerability in any security program. This section outlines controls to mitigate human-related security risks while fostering a security-aware culture.

## Social-Engineering Defense

Protecting against attacks that manipulate people to divulge confidential information or perform actions that compromise security.

### Key Components

1. **Awareness Training**: Educating team members about social engineering tactics
2. **Attack Simulation**: Conducting controlled social engineering exercises
3. **Verification Procedures**: Establishing processes to verify requestor identity
4. **Reporting Mechanisms**: Creating clear channels for reporting suspicious activities
5. **Response Protocols**: Developing procedures for handling potential social engineering incidents

### Implementation Steps

1. Develop targeted training on common social engineering tactics
2. Implement regular phishing simulations and other controlled tests
3. Establish protocols for verifying requests for sensitive information or actions
4. Create and communicate clear procedures for reporting suspicious activities
5. Regularly update training and awareness materials based on current threats

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Community Channels**: Address social engineering in Discord, Telegram, and other platforms
2. **Crypto-Specific Scams**: Educate about common scams like fake airdrops and giveaways
3. **Impersonation**: Train team members to verify identity through secure channels
4. **Public Information**: Consider the risks of publicly available information about team members
5. **Multiple Communication Channels**: Establish out-of-band verification for critical actions

## Insider-Threat Mitigation

Addressing risks posed by team members who may intentionally or unintentionally compromise security.

### Key Components

1. **Access Controls**: Implementing least privilege and separation of duties
2. **Monitoring**: Establishing appropriate monitoring of user activities
3. **Onboarding/Offboarding**: Securing processes for adding and removing team members
4. **Behavior Analytics**: Identifying unusual activities that may indicate threats
5. **Response Procedures**: Developing protocols for addressing potential insider threats

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement robust access controls based on the principle of least privilege
2. Establish monitoring for critical systems and sensitive data access
3. Develop and enforce secure onboarding and offboarding procedures
4. Create guidelines for identifying and reporting concerning behaviors
5. Establish response procedures that balance security with privacy and legal considerations

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Key Management**: Implement controls for those with access to private keys
2. **Multi-Signature Requirements**: Use multi-signature arrangements for critical operations
3. **Distributed Teams**: Address insider threat risks in remote and distributed teams
4. **Pseudonymous Contributors**: Develop trust models for pseudonymous team members
5. **Financial Incentives**: Consider unique incentives related to cryptocurrency holdings

## Security Training & Culture

Building a culture where security is valued and integrated into daily operations.

### Key Components

1. **Security Awareness Program**: Comprehensive training on security principles
2. **Role-Based Training**: Specialized training based on job responsibilities
3. **Security Champions**: Designated representatives who promote security within teams
4. **Continuous Learning**: Ongoing education about emerging threats
5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Recognizing and rewarding security-conscious behavior

### Implementation Steps

1. Develop a comprehensive security awareness program
2. Implement role-specific security training for different functions
3. Establish a security champions program to promote security within teams
4. Create a continuous learning program with regular updates on new threats
5. Develop recognition programs for security-conscious behaviors and reporting
6. Integrate security into performance evaluations and team objectives

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Crypto-Specific Training**: Educate on unique aspects of blockchain security
2. **Open-Source Mindset**: Balance security with transparency in an open-source culture
3. **Decentralized Teams**: Deliver effective training across distributed organizations
4. **Rapidly Evolving Threats**: Keep training current with fast-changing Web3 threats
5. **Community Education**: Extend security awareness to community members and users

## Personnel Security Measures

Ensuring appropriate security controls throughout the employment lifecycle.

### Key Components

1. **Pre-Employment Screening**: Appropriate background checks and verification
2. **Security Agreements**: Confidentiality and acceptable use policies
3. **Clear Expectations**: Defined security responsibilities for all roles
4. **Performance Management**: Integration of security into performance evaluation
5. **Termination Procedures**: Secure processes for departing team members

### Implementation Steps

1. Implement appropriate pre-employment screening procedures
2. Develop and require security agreements for all team members
3. Clearly document security responsibilities in job descriptions
4. Include security considerations in performance evaluations
5. Establish and enforce secure termination procedures

### Web3-Specific Considerations

1. **Pseudonymous Contributors**: Develop alternative verification approaches
2. **Global Teams**: Navigate screening challenges across different jurisdictions
3. **Community Contributors**: Address security for non-employee contributors
4. **DAO Participants**: Establish security expectations in decentralized organizations
5. **Key Recovery**: Implement procedures for key recovery when team members depart

Effective people and personnel controls recognize that security is fundamentally a human issue. By addressing social engineering, insider threats, and security awareness, organizations can transform their people from potential vulnerabilities into a critical line of defense.
