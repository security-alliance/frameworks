# Glossary of Terms

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Operational Security framework. It includes both
general security terminology and Web3-specific concepts to help ensure a common understanding of security concepts.

## General Security Terms

### A

**Access Control**: Systems and policies that restrict access to resources based on user identity and authorization
level.

**Authentication**: The process of verifying the identity of a user, system, or entity.

**Authorization**: The process of determining what actions an authenticated entity is permitted to perform.

**Availability**: The property of being accessible and usable upon demand by an authorized entity.

### B

**Backup**: A copy of data created and stored separately from the original, to enable recovery in case of data loss.

**Breach**: An incident that results in the unauthorized access, disclosure, or acquisition of protected data.

### C

**Confidentiality**: The property that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals,
entities, or processes.

**Configuration Management**: The process of establishing and maintaining consistency of a system's performance and
functional attributes with its requirements and design.

**Containment**: Actions taken to limit the scope and impact of a security incident.

**Countermeasure**: An action, device, procedure, or technique that mitigates a security threat or vulnerability.

### D

**Defense in Depth**: A security strategy that employs multiple layers of controls to protect resources.

**Disaster Recovery**: A set of policies, tools, and procedures to enable the recovery of vital technology
infrastructure and systems following a disaster.

### E

**Encryption**: The process of converting information into a code to prevent unauthorized access.

**Endpoint Security**: The practice of securing entry points of end-user devices such as desktops, laptops, and mobile
devices from being exploited by malicious actors.

### I

**Incident Response**: The process of addressing and managing the aftermath of a security breach or attack.

**Integrity**: The property that data has not been altered in an unauthorized manner since it was created, transmitted,
or stored.

**Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**: A system that monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and issues alerts
when such activity is discovered.

### L

**Least Privilege**: The principle of providing users with the minimum levels of access necessary to perform their job
functions.

**Logging**: The recording of events, activities, and changes within a system or network.

### M

**Malware**: Software designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: An authentication method that requires a user to provide two or more verification
 factors to gain access.

### P

**Penetration Testing**: An authorized simulated attack on a computer system to evaluate its security.

**Phishing**: A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as passwords or credit card details, by
masquerading as a trustworthy entity.

**Principle of Least Privilege**: The concept of granting users only the minimum access rights necessary to perform
their job functions.

### R

**Risk Assessment**: The process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating risk.

**Risk Management**: The coordinated activities to direct and control an organization with regard to risk.

### S

**Security Controls**: Safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks.

**Security Incident**: An event that potentially compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of
information or systems.

**Separation of Duties**: A principle that divides critical functions among different staff members to prevent fraud and
errors.

### T

**Threat**: A potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization.

**Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: A method of confirming a user's claimed identity by utilizing a combination of two
different factors.

### V

**Vulnerability**: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat actor to perform unauthorized actions.

**Vulnerability Assessment**: The process of identifying, quantifying, and prioritizing vulnerabilities in systems,
applications, and network infrastructure.

## Web3-Specific Terms

### A

**Air-Gapped**: A security measure where a computer or network is physically isolated from unsecured networks, such as
the public internet or an insecure local area network.

### B

**Blockchain**: A distributed ledger technology that maintains a continuously growing list of records, called blocks,
which are linked and secured using cryptography.

### C

**Cold Storage**: The practice of keeping a reserve of cryptocurrency offline, typically in hardware wallets or paper
wallets.

**Consensus Mechanism**: The process in a blockchain network that achieves agreement among distributed processes or
systems on a single data value.

**Custodial Wallet**: A cryptocurrency wallet where the private keys are held by a third-party service.

### D

**Decentralized Application (DApp)**: An application that runs on a decentralized network, avoiding a single point of
control or failure.

**Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**: An organization represented by rules encoded as a computer program that
is transparent, controlled by the organization members, and not influenced by a central government.

### E

**Externally Owned Account (EOA)**: An Ethereum account controlled by a private key, typically belonging to a person.

### G

**Gas**: A unit that measures the amount of computational effort required to execute operations on the Ethereum network.

### H

**Hardware Wallet**: A special type of cryptocurrency wallet that stores the user's private keys in a secure hardware
device.

**Hot Wallet**: A cryptocurrency wallet that is connected to the internet, allowing for quick transactions but with
increased security risks.

### M

**Mempool**: A collection of all transaction data that have been verified by nodes but have not yet been recorded onto
the blockchain.

**Multisignature (Multisig)**: A digital signature scheme that allows a group of users to sign a single document, with
multiple parties required to authorize a transaction.

### N

**Node**: A computer that connects to a blockchain network and maintains a copy of the blockchain.

**Non-Custodial Wallet**: A cryptocurrency wallet where users have full control over their private keys and
cryptocurrency.

### P

**Private Key**: A secret number that allows cryptocurrency to be spent. It is paired with a public key in asymmetric
cryptography.

**Public Key**: A cryptographic key that can be obtained and used by anyone to encrypt messages intended for a
particular recipient, such that the encrypted messages can only be decrypted by the recipient's paired private key.

### S

**Smart Contract**: Self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code, which
automatically enforce and execute the terms when predetermined conditions are met.

**Seed Phrase**: A series of words generated by cryptocurrency wallets that give users access to the cryptocurrency
associated with that wallet.

### T

**Token**: A digital asset that is created, issued, and managed on an existing blockchain.

**Transaction**: The record of a change in ownership of a cryptocurrency or the execution of a smart contract.

### W

**Wallet**: Software that stores private and public keys and interacts with various blockchain to enable users to send
and receive digital currency and monitor their balance.

**Web3**: The concept of a new iteration of the web which incorporates concepts such as decentralization, blockchain
technologies, and token-based economics.

This glossary provides a common language for discussing operational security concepts. Understanding these terms is
essential for effective communication about security risks, controls, and practices in both traditional and Web3
environments.
