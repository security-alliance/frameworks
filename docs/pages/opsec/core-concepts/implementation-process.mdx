# Operational Implementation Process

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway**: Operational security is implemented through a practical five-phase process: critical asset
> identification, practical threat analysis, actionable vulnerability assessment, contextual risk evaluation, and
> targeted control deployment.

## Relationship to Security Fundamentals

This document outlines a practical implementation process for operational security that organizations can follow in
sequence. This process complements the [Security Fundamentals](/opsec/core-concepts/security-fundamentals) document,
which defines the guiding principles:

- This process provides a **sequential workflow** for security teams to follow
- The fundamentals establish **enduring principles** that shape security architecture

While this process offers a concrete methodology for implementation, the fundamentals establish the ongoing security
approaches that must be maintained throughout your systems. Both elements must work together: the fundamentals guide
your overall approach, while this process provides the tactical roadmap.

For organizations just beginning their security journey, start here with these concrete implementation steps.

## 1. Critical Asset Identification

Map and document the assets that would cause significant harm to your organization if compromised.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** This phase integrates with [Asset Inventory](/infrastructure/asset-inventory) practices and
> drives [Data Protection](/opsec/old/data-protection/overview) strategies.

### Implementation Actions

1. Conduct asset discovery across your environment using both automated tools and manual inventorying
   - Digital assets: Use network scanning, CMDB tools, and cloud resource inventories
   - Physical assets: Document hardware, systems and access points
2. Apply a practical classification system with clear, actionable categories
   - High-value assets: Direct financial impact if compromised (e.g., private keys, treasury wallets)
   - Operational assets: Required for continued business operations
   - Sensitive data: Includes Customer information, intellectual property, strategic plans
3. Map information flows to understand how data moves between systems
4. Assign specific owners responsible for each asset category
5. Establish a sustainable review cadence based on your environment
   - High-volatility environments: Monthly reviews
   - Stable environments: Quarterly reviews
   - Document trigger events that require immediate reassessment (e.g., acquisitions, new product, etc.)

## 2. Practical Threat Analysis

Identify specific, relevant threat actors and their tactics based on your organization's profile.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For hands-on approaches, see
> [Understanding Threat Vectors](/awareness/understanding-threat-vectors) and [Threat Modeling](/threat-modeling/overview)
> frameworks.

### Implementation Actions

1. Create a focused threat profile based on:
   - Your industry's recent attack history (consult threat intelligence reports)
   - Your organization's specific attack surface
   - The value of your assets to different adversaries
2. Document concrete adversary personas with specific capabilities:
   - External attackers: Targeted vs. opportunistic
   - Insider risks: Privileged users, contractors, disgruntled employees
   - Supply chain actors: Vendors with access to your systems
3. Map threat actors to their likely tactics using MITRE ATT&CK or similar frameworks
4. Establish threat intelligence feeds relevant to your environment
5. Create a lightweight process for updating threat models when new intelligence emerges

## 3. Actionable Vulnerability Assessment

Systematically identify and validate weaknesses in your environment through practical testing.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** This aligns with the [Security Testing](/security-testing/overview) framework and includes
> practices like [Static Application Security Testing](/security-testing/overview) and [Dynamic Application Security Testing](/security-testing/overview).

### Implementation Actions

1. Implement a layered vulnerability discovery program:
   - Automated scanning: Deploy tools appropriate for your environment (infrastructure, applications, cloud)
   - Manual testing: Conduct regular penetration tests focusing on critical systems
   - Red team exercises: Simulate real-world attacks against your defenses
2. Examine security processes for operational gaps:
   - Incident response procedures: Test through tabletop exercises
   - Access management: Audit privilege escalation paths
   - Change management: Review for security bypass opportunities
3. Evaluate security awareness through:
   - Targeted phishing simulations
   - Knowledge assessments
   - Procedural compliance checks
4. Document findings in a centralized vulnerability management system with clear ownership
5. Implement a consistent vulnerability scoring system to enable prioritization

## 4. Contextual Risk Evaluation

Analyze identified risks in the context of your business to drive informed decision-making.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** For practical approaches, see [Governance](/governance/overview) and
> [Risk Management](/governance/risk-management) frameworks.

### Implementation Actions

1. Establish a practical risk calculation methodology that considers:
   - Business impact (financial, operational, reputational)
   - Exploitation likelihood based on real-world attack patterns
   - Existing control effectiveness
2. Create a prioritized risk register with clear owners and timelines
3. Define risk acceptance criteria based on your organization's risk tolerance
4. Develop risk narratives that translate technical findings into business impacts
5. Implement a streamlined risk review process that:
   - Enables timely decisions
   - Involves appropriate stakeholders
   - Documents rationale for future reference
   - Triggers reassessment when conditions change

## 5. Targeted Control Deployment

Implement security controls that address prioritized risks while minimizing operational friction.

> **🔗 Related Framework:** Implementation integrates with [Security Automation](/security-automation/overview) and
> control frameworks like [Infrastructure](/infrastructure/overview) and
> [Identity and Access Management](/iam/overview).

### Implementation Actions

1. Design a defense-in-depth strategy with layered controls:
   - Preventive: Stop attacks before they succeed
   - Detective: Identify attacks in progress
   - Responsive: Limit damage from successful attacks
   - Recovery: Restore normal operations
2. Select controls using a balanced approach:
   - Technical feasibility in your environment
   - Implementation and maintenance costs
   - Potential operational impact
   - Coverage of multiple risks where possible
3. Implement controls using a phased approach:
   - Quick wins: Deploy high-impact, low-effort controls first
   - Foundational controls: Build core security capabilities
   - Advanced measures: Address sophisticated threats
4. Validate control effectiveness through:
   - Technical testing
   - Process verification
   - Metrics collection
5. Document clear procedures for:
   - Control operation
   - Maintenance requirements
   - Monitoring and alerting
   - Incident response when controls fail
