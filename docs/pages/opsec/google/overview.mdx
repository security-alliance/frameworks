## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway:** Enhance your Google account security by implementing robust 2FA, eliminating redundant recovery
> options, and diligently overseeing third-party access.

**Google** provides a wide range of services—from email to file storage. Safeguarding your Google account is among the
most critical steps you can take to protect your personal and professional data. Below are simple yet effective measures
to improve your Google account security.

---

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal Google account. All team members and admins should configure these on their own accounts.

>This section does not include Google Suite or more advanced security configurations. For that, refer to the Operational
> Security Framework, under [Google Suite Security](/opsec/old/cloud-third-party/g-suite-security).

### Account Security Checklist

- [Google Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security):
  - [ ]  Settings > Security > Skip passwords when possible > **Enabled**
    - *Skipping password entry allows you to renew logins in public places without having to type out your password or
    store it in your clipboard*
  - [ ]  Settings > Security > Recovery email > **Enabled**
  - [ ]  Settings > Security > [Recovery phone](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/rescuephone) > **Disabled**
    - By default, Google allows account recovery using phone numbers and emails. Attackers can exploit these if they
    compromise your phone or email.
    - **Optional**: If you're confident you won't need standard recovery processes, also remove [Recovery Email](https://myaccount.google.com/recovery/email)
  - [ ]  Settings > Security > Third-party apps with account access > Remove all unnecessary
    - Some apps request extensive permissions (e.g., full inbox or file access). Regularly review these to minimize
    risks.
  - [ ]  Settings > Security > [Your devices](https://myaccount.google.com/device-activity) > Log out from all
  unnecessary devices
    - Keeping track of active sessions helps you detect unauthorized access.
  - [ ]  Security > Enhanced Safe Browsing > **Enabled**
- [2-Step Verification](https://myaccount.google.com/signinoptions/two-step-verification):
  - Properly setting up two-factor authentication (2FA) is one of the most crucial steps you can take. Disable SMS 2FA
  to avoid SIM swaps, and instead use an authenticator app or a hardware security key (preferred).
  - [ ]  Enable any, but passkeys or authenticator recommended. You can also continue using **Google prompts**.
  - [ ]  Disable "Voice or text message" if enabled
  - [ ]  Remove any App passwords
  - [ ]  Store Backup Codes offline in a secure place
- [Google Connections](https://myaccount.google.com/connections):
  - [ ]  Review each connected app's permissions; remove if unnecessary or excessive
- [Google Profile](https://myaccount.google.com/profile):
  - Publicly visible personal info can aid attackers in impersonating you.
  - [ ]  Check Visibility: If any info is set to "Anyone," switch it to private if unnecessary
  - [ ]  **Birthday:** Consider making it private

---

### Extended Security Settings

For a comprehensive security review, follow these steps from [Google Security](https://myaccount.google.com/security):

- [ ]  "Your connection to third-party apps & Services" > Revoke all applications that should not be connected
- [ ]  "Log out of all unknown devices"
- [ ]  "Turn off" skip password when possible (below previous step)
- [ ]  "How you sign in with Google" > Set up your 2FA or Security Key
- [ ]  Ensure you do not have a recovery phone setup. No SMS 2FA or phone number on your account at all.
- [ ]  Change your password after completing these steps
- [ ]  Note down your backup codes

> If using Google Authenticator as a 2FA app on your phone, disconnect it from the cloud, as backup codes are then stored
> in the google cloud associated to email. Use it without an account and ensure backup codes are written down offline.

### Advanced Protection Program

For those who are public figures or need heightened security, Google's **Advanced Protection Program** is worth
considering. It requires the use of security keys, limits access to unverified apps, and makes the process of account
recovery more challenging.

- [ ]  [Enroll in Advanced Protection Program](https://myaccount.google.com/advanced-protection/landing)

---

### Best Practices & Ongoing Maintenance

- [ ]  **Review Security Alerts:** Pay attention to any email or phone notifications from Google regarding unusual
sign-ins or account changes.
- [ ]  **Perform a Security Checkup:** Regularly visit [Google's Security Checkup](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup)
to identify potential issues and resolve them.
- [ ]  **Consider** using identity **monitoring** apps like [Push Security](pushsecurity.com).
