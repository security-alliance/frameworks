# The Five Steps of the OpSec Process

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway**: OpSec is built on five critical steps: identifying what needs protection, analyzing potential threats, assessing vulnerabilities, evaluating risks, and implementing appropriate countermeasures.

If we were to summarize the most crucial and important steps of Operational Security, whether it is for an individual or an organization, we would do as follows. These are not step-by-steps, but can serve as a kick-off process to be further improved after its first iteration.

## 1. Identification of Critical Information

Determine what information, if obtained by adversaries, could harm your organization or operations.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** This step aligns with [Asset Inventory](/infrastructure/asset-inventory) practices and informs [Data Protection](/opsec/old/data-protection/overview) strategies.

### Implementation

1. Create an inventory of all sensitive information assets
2. Classify information based on sensitivity and impact if compromised
3. Document where critical information is stored, processed, and transmitted
4. Identify the owners and authorized users of each information asset
5. Regularly review and update your critical information inventory

## 2. Threat Analysis

Identify potential adversaries, their capabilities, and their interest in your critical information.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For detailed approaches, see [Understanding Threat Vectors](/awareness/understanding-threat-vectors) and [Threat Modeling](/opsec/threat-modeling-overview) frameworks.

### Implementation

1. Research known threat actors relevant to your industry or organization
2. Analyze adversaries' motivations, resources, and methods
3. Consider both external threats (hackers, competitors) and internal threats (insiders)
4. Stay informed about emerging threats and attack techniques
5. Document threat scenarios specific to your organization's context

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment

Analyze how your critical information might be exposed through vulnerabilities in your systems, processes, or personnel.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** This connects with [Security Testing](/security-testing/overview) framework, including [Static Application Security Testing]() {/*TODO: link not found:/security-testing/static-application-security-testing*/}, [Dynamic Application Security Testing]() {/*TODO: link not found:../security-testing/dynamic-application-security-testing.md*/}, and vulnerability management practices.

### Implementation

1. Conduct technical vulnerability scans of systems and networks
2. Review processes and procedures for security gaps
3. Assess personnel security awareness and adherence to security policies
4. Examine physical security controls protecting critical assets
5. Evaluate third-party and supply chain vulnerabilities that could impact your organization

## 4. Risk Assessment

Evaluate the likelihood and potential impact of various threats exploiting identified vulnerabilities.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** For comprehensive approaches, see [Governance](/governance/overview) and [Risk Management](/governance/risk-management) frameworks.

### Implementation

1. Calculate risk based on threat probability and potential impact
2. Prioritize risks based on severity and criticality to operations
3. Document acceptable risk thresholds for different types of assets
4. Consider cascading effects of security compromises
5. Present risk assessments in clear terms for executive decision-making

## 5. Countermeasure Implementation

Develop and deploy security controls to mitigate identified risks, considering cost, effectiveness, and operational impact.

> **ðŸ”— Related Framework:** Implementation connects with [Security Automation](/security-automation/overview) and various control frameworks like [Infrastructure](/infrastructure/overview) and [Identity and Access Management](/iam/overview).

### Implementation

1. Select appropriate technical, administrative, and physical controls
2. Implement controls based on risk prioritization
3. Test controls to ensure they function as intended
4. Document procedures for maintaining and updating controls
5. Train personnel on new security measures and their importance
