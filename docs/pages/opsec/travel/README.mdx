# Operational Security while traveling

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway**: Travel introduces unique security risks to your digital assets and sensitive information. Proper preparation before, vigilance during, and careful review after travel creates a comprehensive defense strategy that balances security with practical usability.

When we travel, our normal security routines are disrupted, and we face elevated risks from physical theft, digital surveillance, border inspections, and social engineering. Web3 professionals face additional challenges when traveling with crypto assets or access to treasury funds.

The resources in this section provide practical guidance for maintaining operational security while traveling:

- [OpSec Travel Guide](/opsec/travel/guide) - A comprehensive resource covering all aspects of travel security with in-depth explanations and implementation details
- [Too Long; Did not Read version](/opsec/travel/tldr) - A condensed checklist format for quick security planning before and during travel

## Three-phase Security Approach

Our travel security framework is organized into three critical phases:

1. **Pre-travel preparation**: Risk assessment, device hardening, backup creation, and contingency planning
2. **On-trip vigilance**: Network security, physical device protection, social engineering awareness, and maintaining operational security
3. **Post-travel review**: Device inspection, account security verification, and lessons learned documentation

Additional considerations are provided for high-risk travelers who may face targeted threats due to their role or access to valuable assets.
