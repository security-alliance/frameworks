# Threat Modeling Overview

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />


> üîë **Key takeaway**: Think of threat modeling as your security roadmap. It's how you understand what you need to protect, who might try to steal it, and how they might do it. From random hackers to state actors, knowing your potential attackers helps you build defenses that actually matter. It's about being smart with your security resources and focusing on what really needs protection.

Effective security requires understanding **what you're protecting and who you're protecting it from**. Without a structured threat model, security efforts become unfocused and inefficient. Different entities face different threats based on their assets, visibility, and technological footprint.

## Why is it important

Failure to implement threat modeling has led to catastrophic security breaches:

- [How Threat Modeling Could Have Prevented the 1.5B ByBit Hack](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2025/02/25/how-threat-modeling-could-have-prevented-the-1.5b-bybit-hack/)
- [North Korea's Lazarus Group stole $620 million from Axie Infinity's Ronin bridge (2022)](https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0768) through a sophisticated attack targeting blockchain infrastructure
- [The Nomad bridge lost $190 million (2022)](https://medium.com/nomad-xyz-blog/nomad-bridge-hack-root-cause-analysis-875ad2e5aacd) through a critical vulnerability that allowed attackers to bypass transaction validation
- [The 2020 Twitter compromise](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/an-update-on-our-security-incident) resulted in hijacked high-profile accounts being used for cryptocurrency scams

### Common pitfalls & examples

- **Tunnel vision**: The Colonial Pipeline attack (2021) succeeded through a legacy VPN account without MFA, while the company focused security resources on operational technology
- **Unrealistic scenarios**: Many organizations over-invested in zero-day defense while leaving basic phishing vulnerabilities open
- **Static models**: Equifax's 2017 breach occurred partly because threat models weren't updated to reflect new attack patterns
- **Insider blindness**: The 2020 Twitter compromise of high-profile accounts happened when internal admin tools weren't included in threat modeling

Organizations that implement threat modeling can focus limited security resources on their most significant risks, avoiding both over-protection of low-value assets and under-protection of critical systems. A DeFi protocol that fails to properly identify potential attack vectors, might focus extensively on their website and marketing infrastructure while overlooking smart contract security.

Effective threat modeling ensures security teams can identify and document all potential attack paths - enabling risk management teams to later assess and prioritize these threats effectively. Without threat modeling, organizations often distribute security resources evenly across all assets regardless of risk levels.

### Asset inventory

1. **Digital value stores**: Document cryptocurrencies, tokens, NFTs, and any assets directly convertible to monetary value
2. **Credentials & access information**: Catalog passwords, API keys, recovery seeds/phrases, private keys, and other non-physical authentication data
3. Identify all **Hardware & physical devices**:
   - **Computing devices**: Computers, phones, tablets, servers
   - **Security hardware**: Hardware wallets, YubiKeys, MFA devices, HSMs
   - **Physical security**: Office equipment, security systems, physical access controls
4. **Infrastructure & systems**: Map cloud resources, development environments, network equipment, and third-party services
5. **Sensitive information & intellectual property**: Track code repositories, proprietary algorithms, customer data, business documents, email archives, and backup files
6. **Legal & compliance assets**: Identify digital certificates, identity documents, contracts, and regulatory compliance documentation

For these, you can use technologies such as:

- Configuration Management Databases (CMDBs)
- Specialized asset tracking software
- GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) platforms with asset inventory modules

### Adversary analysis

1. **Classify potential attackers by tiers**:
   - **Tier 1 (Opportunistic)**: Random cybercriminals, script kiddies, automated scanners
   - **Tier 2 (Targeted)**: Organized crime groups, corporate competitors, angry ex-employees
   - **Tier 3 (Advanced)**: Nation-state actors, APT groups, sophisticated criminal syndicates
2. **Document adversary capabilities and motivations**:
   - Technical capabilities and resources
   - Financial motivations or strategic goals
   - Persistence level (hit-and-run vs. long-term compromise)

- **Community/Marketing**: Consider reputation risks and public-facing attack surfaces

## Practical Frameworks and Tools

After completing the asset inventory, adversary analysis, and attack vector mapping, organizations can leverage established frameworks and visualization techniques to systematize their threat modeling approach. These tools help translate the theoretical understanding of threats into practical, actionable security measures.

### STRIDE Threat Categorization Framework

The STRIDE framework, developed by Microsoft in the late 1990s, offers a systematic approach to identifying and categorizing threats. It maps directly to key security properties that must be protected in any system:

| STRIDE Category | Security Property Violated | Description | Example in Web3 | Common Mitigations |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **S**poofing | Authentication | Impersonating something or someone else | Phishing attacks to steal wallet credentials | Strong MFA, hardware security keys, signing operations |
| **T**ampering | Integrity | Modifying data or code | Smart contract manipulation through vulnerable functions | Integrity checks, code signing, immutable audit logs |
| **R**epudiation | Non-repudiation | Denying performed actions | Disputing transaction authorization | Blockchain transaction signing, comprehensive logging |
| **I**nformation disclosure | Confidentiality | Exposing sensitive data | Private key extraction from insecure storage | Encryption, proper key management, minimal privilege |
| **D**enial of service | Availability | Disrupting availability for legitimate users | Network congestion attacks, high gas fees | Rate limiting, redundancy, circuit breakers |
| **E**levation of privilege | Authorization | Gaining unauthorized access | Exploiting admin functions in contracts | Least privilege, strict role separation, multi-sig |

Organizations can apply STRIDE systematically to each component identified in their asset inventory to ensure comprehensive threat coverage.

### Attack Trees: Visualizing Attack Paths

Attack trees provide a structured method to visualize potential attack scenarios against critical assets. They help security teams understand the relationship between different attack vectors and identify the most critical paths requiring mitigation:

```
Goal: Steal crypto assets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Compromise user wallet
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Phishing attack
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mitigate: Security awareness training
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Malware infection
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mitigate: Endpoint protection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Attack exchange
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ API key theft
‚îÇ   ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mitigate: IP restrictions, 2FA
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Credential stuffing
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mitigate: Unique passwords, MFA
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SIM swapping
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mitigate: Hardware keys, non-SMS 2FA
```
