# Human-Centered Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Security is not just about technologyâ€”it's about people. The human element is often the most vulnerable part of any
security system, making human-centered security approaches essential for a robust operational security posture.

## Introduction

Human-centered security focuses on understanding, supporting, and enhancing the security behaviors of individuals within
an organization. It recognizes that security is a shared responsibility and that technical controls alone cannot
provide comprehensive protection without considering the human factors involved.

## Key Components

This section covers the following aspects of human-centered security:

1. [Insider Threat Detection and Mitigation](/opsec/old/human-centered-security/detecting-and-mitigating-insider-threats)
   - Strategies for identifying and mitigating risks posed by insiders
2. [Social Engineering Defense](/opsec/old/human-centered-security/social-engineering-defense) - Techniques to protect
against manipulation and deception
3. [Travel Security](/opsec/old/human-centered-security/travel-security) - Security considerations for team members when
traveling
4. [Personal OpSec for Team Members](/opsec/old/human-centered-security/personal-opsec) - Guidelines for individuals to
maintain security in their personal activities

## Intersection with Awareness

While this section focuses on operational measures to address human-centered security, it works in close conjunction
with the [Security Awareness Framework](/awareness/overview). The awareness framework provides the educational
foundation, while human-centered security implements the operational controls and procedures needed to protect against
human-related security risks.

## Risk-Based Approach

Not all human-centered security risks are equal. Organizations should adopt a risk-based approach by:

1. Identifying roles with access to critical assets or sensitive information
2. Assessing the potential impact of human errors or malicious actions
3. Implementing controls proportionate to the identified risks
4. Creating an environment where security is valued and prioritized

Focusing on human factors in security, organizations can create a more resilient security posture that combines
technical controls with human awareness and behavior.
