# Travel Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Team members traveling for business purposes face unique security risks that require specialized preparation and awareness. Effective travel security measures help protect both the individual and organizational assets during travel.

## Pre-Travel Preparation

### Risk Assessment

1. Assess destination-specific risks including political stability, crime rates, health concerns, and local laws
2. Consider the sensitivity of work to be conducted during travel and adjust security measures accordingly
3. Consult reliable sources such as government travel advisories and internal threat intelligence

### Device Preparation

1. Use dedicated travel devices whenever possible, with minimal data and applications
2. Update all software and security patches before departure
3. Enable full-disk encryption on all devices
4. Install and test VPN software prior to departure
5. Consider using temporary travel accounts with limited access to organizational resources
6. Backup all data before departure and store the backup securely

### Documentation and Emergency Planning

1. Create copies of important documents (passport, visas, insurance)
2. Establish emergency communication protocols and points of contact
3. Share itinerary details with appropriate team members
4. Register with embassy or consular services when traveling to high-risk locations

## In-Transit Security

1. Maintain physical control of devices and sensitive items at all times
2. Be aware of shoulder surfing when working on sensitive information
3. Avoid connecting to public or hotel Wi-Fi networks without VPN protection
4. Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other wireless connectivity when not in use
5. Consider using privacy screens to prevent visual data leakage

## On-Location Security

### Physical Security

1. Store sensitive devices in hotel safes when not in use, or maintain physical possession
2. Be aware of surroundings and potential surveillance or targeting
3. Avoid discussing sensitive business matters in public spaces
4. Use privacy screens when working in public areas

### Digital Security

1. Connect to corporate networks only through secure VPN channels
2. Be cautious of USB charging stations which may present data theft risks
3. Report any suspicious activity or security incidents immediately
4. Exercise extra caution when connecting to Wi-Fi networks
5. Use mobile hotspots from trusted providers when possible

## Post-Travel Procedures

1. Inspect devices for signs of tampering
2. Change passwords used during travel
3. Run security scans on all devices before reconnecting to corporate networks
4. Report any suspicious incidents or security concerns
5. Debrief with security team about any potential security issues encountered

## Special Considerations for High-Risk Locations

1. Consider using "burner" devices for travel to high-risk locations
2. Establish more frequent check-in protocols
3. Be aware of local surveillance capabilities and legal requirements for device inspection
4. Prepare for potential device confiscation at borders by minimizing sensitive data
5. Consider using end-to-end encrypted communication methods

## Web3-Specific Travel Security

1. Use hardware wallets for storing crypto assets and keep them physically secure
2. Be cautious about revealing cryptocurrency holdings or involvement in high-value projects
3. Consider using duress passwords or accounts if traveling to high-risk regions
4. Be aware of targeted attacks at crypto conferences and events
5. Establish specific protocols for transaction approvals while traveling

## Integration with Other Security Frameworks

Travel security integrates with several other security frameworks:

1. [Device and Endpoint Security](/opsec/old/device-endpoint-security/overview) for device hardening practices
2. [Digital Identity and Access Management](/opsec/old/digital-identity-access/overview) for authentication during travel
3. [Physical Security](/opsec/old/physical-security/overview) for protecting physical assets

By implementing comprehensive travel security measures, organizations can significantly reduce risks associated with business travel while enabling team members to work effectively and safely when away from their primary work location.
