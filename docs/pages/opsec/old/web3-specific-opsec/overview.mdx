# Web3-Specific Operational Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Web3 introduces unique operational security challenges that require specialized approaches beyond traditional security measures. This section focuses on the specific security considerations for organizations operating in the blockchain and decentralized ecosystem.

## Introduction

Web3 operational security addresses the distinct threats and vulnerabilities associated with blockchain technologies, decentralized applications, smart contracts, and cryptocurrency operations. The immutable and often public nature of blockchain transactions, combined with the self-custodial responsibility of managing cryptographic assets, creates a security landscape that requires specialized knowledge and techniques.

## Key Components

This section covers the following aspects of Web3-specific operational security:

{/* TODO: check what to do with links:  1. [Wallet Security](./wallet-security.md) - Securing cryptocurrency and NFT wallets
2. [Smart Contract Operational Security](./smart-contract-opsec.md) - Operational considerations for deploying and managing smart contracts
3. [Blockchain Transaction Security](./transaction-security.md) - Securing blockchain transactions against various threats
4. [Decentralized Identity Management](./decentralized-identity.md) - Managing identities in decentralized systems
5. [DAO Security Operations](./dao-security.md) - Operational security considerations for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations
6. [Validator and Node Security](./validator-node-security.md) - Securing blockchain nodes and validators */}

## Risk-Based Approach

Web3 operational security should be implemented based on the value of assets being managed and the criticality of on-chain operations:

1. Inventory all blockchain assets, wallets, and contracts
2. Classify these assets based on value and criticality to operations
3. Implement appropriate security controls based on risk levels
4. Regularly audit security practices and adapt to emerging threats

## Intersection with Traditional Security

While Web3 introduces unique security challenges, it does not replace the need for traditional security measures. This section highlights where Web3-specific controls should be integrated with:

- Traditional identity and access management
- Device and endpoint security
- Network and communication security
- Human-centered security approaches

By combining Web3-specific security measures with traditional operational security practices, organizations can build a comprehensive security posture suitable for the decentralized ecosystem.
