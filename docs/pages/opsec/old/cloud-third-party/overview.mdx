# Cloud and Third-Party Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

In today's interconnected digital ecosystem, organizations rely heavily on cloud services and third-party vendors to operate efficiently. However, these dependencies introduce security risks that must be carefully managed.

## Introduction

Cloud and third-party security focuses on protecting data and operations that depend on external providers. It encompasses the assessment, monitoring, and management of security risks associated with cloud services, software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications, and third-party vendors that have access to your systems or data.

## Key Components

This section covers the following aspects of cloud and third-party security:

1. [G-Suite Security](legacy/cloud-third-party/g-suite-security) - Securing Google Workspace (formerly G-Suite) environments
2. [Cloud Security Fundamentals]() {/*TODO: link not found : ./cloud-security-fundamentals.md */} - Essential security considerations for cloud environments
3. [SaaS Security]() {/*TODO: link not found : ./saas-security.md */} - Securing software-as-a-service applications
4. [Vendor Security Assessment]() {/*TODO: link not found : ./vendor-security-assessment.md */} - Evaluating and monitoring the security of third-party vendors
5. [API Security]() {/*TODO: link not found : ./api-security.md */} - Securing application programming interfaces

## Risk-Based Approach

Cloud and third-party security should be implemented based on the sensitivity of the data being handled and the criticality of the services provided:

1. Inventory all cloud services and third-party relationships
2. Classify providers based on the data they handle and criticality to operations
3. Implement appropriate security controls and monitoring based on risk levels
4. Regularly review and audit third-party security practices

## Web3 Considerations

In Web3 environments, cloud and third-party security includes additional considerations:

- The security of blockchain infrastructure providers
- The risks associated with decentralized services and protocols
- The assessment of smart contract dependencies
- The security of Web3 development and deployment tools

The guidance in this section addresses both traditional and Web3-specific cloud and third-party security considerations.
