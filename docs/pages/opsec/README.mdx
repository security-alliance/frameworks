# Operational Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Operational Security (OpSec) is a systematic approach to identifying critical information, determining threats to that information, analyzing vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing countermeasures to protect sensitive data and operations. This framework provides comprehensive guidance for implementing effective operational security practices in Web2 and Web3 environments.

## Core Components

This framework is organized into several interconnected components:

1. [Overview](/opsec/overview/README): Core principles and concepts of operational security
2. [Threat Modeling Overview](/opsec/threat-modeling-overview): Identifying and analyzing potential security threats
3. [Risk Management Overview](/opsec/risk-management-overview): Identifying, assessing, and mitigating security risks
4. [Monitoring & Detection Overview](/opsec/monitoring-detection): Continuous monitoring of security events and anomalies
5. [Incident Response & Recovery Overview](/opsec/incident-response-recovery): Handling security incidents when they occur
6. [Governance & Program Management Overview](/opsec/governance-program-management): Establishing security leadership and organizational structures
7. [Control Domains Overview](/opsec/control-domains): Key areas requiring specific security controls and practices
8. [Lifecycle Overview](/opsec/lifecycle): The continuous process of implementing and maintaining security measures
9. [Continuous Improvement Overview](/opsec/continuous-improvement-metrics): Learning from incidents and evolving security practices

## Using This Framework

Organizations should adapt this framework to their specific needs, considering their size, resources, and risk profile. Start with the fundamentals and gradually implement more advanced controls as your security program matures.

The guidance provided here is designed to be practical and actionable, with specific recommendations that can be implemented by Web3 teams of all sizes.
