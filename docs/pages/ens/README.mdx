# ENS Best Practices

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway**: To securely implement ENS in your applications, prioritize direct L1 data verification, enforce proper name normalization, and validate bidirectional resolution. Always verify interface support before interaction, respect chain-specific cointype parameters, and implement [CCIP-Read](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) functionality correctly. These practices prevent address spoofing, ensure cross-chain compatibility, and maintain data integrity throughout the ENS ecosystem.

The Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain.

ENS maps human-readable names like 'alice.eth' to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, other cryptocurrency addresses, content hashes, metadata, and more. ENS also supports 'reverse resolution', making it possible to associate metadata such as primary names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

## What This Framework Covers

This best practices framework includes guidance on:

* **[Data Integrity & Verification](/ens/data-integrity-verification)** - Ensuring reliable and secure name resolution
* **[Cross-Chain Compatibility](/ens/cross-chain-compatibility)** - Supporting ENS across multiple blockchain networks
* **[Smart Contract Integration](/ens/smart-contract-integration)** - Leveraging ENS in smart contract systems
* **[Interface Compliance](/ens/interface-compliance)** - Correctly implementing and [verifying ENS interfaces](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-165)
* **[Name Handling & Normalization](/ens/name-handling-normalization)** - Properly processing and displaying ENS names

These recommendations are designed for developers integrating ENS into applications, wallets, smart contracts, or other blockchain systems. Following these practices will help create more secure, reliable, and user-friendly ENS implementations.
