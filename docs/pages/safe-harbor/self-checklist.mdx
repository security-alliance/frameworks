# Safe Harbor Eligibility Checklist

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Use this checklist to evaluate whether adopting the **SEAL Whitehat Safe Harbor Agreement** makes sense for your
protocol.

## Can Safe Harbor Help Your Protocol?

- [ ] **Do you hold user funds in smart contracts?** Without Safe Harbor, whitehats who could save your users' funds
might hesitate to act due to legal uncertainty around unauthorized access.
- [ ] **Do you want whitehats to help during active attacks?** Safe Harbor gives ethical hackers legal protection to
intervene immediately, before attackers can drain your protocol.
- [ ] **Do you already have a bug bounty or security disclosure program?** Safe Harbor fills the critical gap your bug
bounty can't cover - live attacks happening right now when disclosure timelines don't matter.
- [ ] **Do you want to increase the odds of recovering funds?** Safe Harbor encourages rescue attempts by trusted
whitehats.

If you checked any of the above - you can benefit from adopting our Safe Harbor.

## What Does Adoption Involve?

1. Define your scope (what's covered, where funds go, bounty %, etc.)
2. (If DAO) Pass a governance proposal
3. Register on-chain
4. Update your Terms of Service and documentation
5. Make a public announcement to inform users and whitehats

It's fast, flexible (DAO or non-DAO), and aligns with industry standards.
