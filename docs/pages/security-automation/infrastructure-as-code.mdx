# Infrastructure as Code

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable
definition files, rather than manual  configuration or interactive configuration tools. Automating security within IaC
helps ensure that infrastructure is configured securely and consistently.

## Benefits of Automating Security in IaC

1. **Consistency**
   - Ensures that infrastructure is provisioned and configured consistently across environments.
   - Reduces the risk of configuration drift and security misconfigurations.

2. **Scalability**
   - Enables scalable deployment of secure infrastructure.
   - Simplifies management of large-scale environments.

3. **Version Control**
   - Treats infrastructure configurations as code, allowing version control and change tracking.
   - Facilitates rollback to previous configurations if issues arise.

## Best Practices for Secure IaC

1. **Use Trusted Modules**
   - Use trusted and verified modules or templates for infrastructure provisioning.
   - Avoid using unverified or outdated modules that may contain vulnerabilities.

2. **Implement Least Privilege**
   - Ensure that infrastructure components have the minimum necessary permissions.
   - Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions.

3. **Automate Security Scans**
   - Integrate security scanning tools into the IaC pipeline to automatically detect and remediate vulnerabilities.
   - Use tools like Checkov, tfsec, and Terrascan to scan Terraform configurations for security issues.

4. **Encrypt Sensitive Data**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the infrastructure.
   - Use managed encryption services provided by cloud providers.

5. **Regularly Update IaC Templates**
   - Keep IaC templates and modules up to date with the latest security patches and best practices.
   - Regularly review and update configurations to address new security threats.

## Tools for Automating Security in IaC

1. **Terraform**
   - A widely used IaC tool that allows for the automated provisioning of infrastructure across various cloud providers.
   - Supports integration with security scanning tools like tfsec and Checkov.

2. **AWS CloudFormation**
   - An IaC service provided by AWS for modeling and setting up AWS resources.
   - Supports AWS Config rules for automated compliance checks.

3. **Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates**
   - IaC templates for deploying and managing Azure resources.
   - Integrates with Azure Policy for enforcing security policies.

4. **Ansible**
   - An open-source automation tool for configuration management and application deployment.
   - Supports security roles and playbooks for automating security configurations.
