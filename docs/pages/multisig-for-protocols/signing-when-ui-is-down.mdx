# Signing When UI is Down

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

If the default interfaces for either Safe or Squads are down or suspected of being compromised, these alternatives enable continued critical signing operations. As a signer, you should familiarize yourself with these tools and practice signing transactions with your team.

## Preparation

**It is recommended to download dependencies ahead of time and store them in a secure location** so they are easily accessible during emergencies.

## EVM Networks

### Eternal Safe - Decentralized fork of Safe{Wallet}

#### Access Options
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/eternalsafe/wallet
- **Hosted (IPFS)**: https://eternalsafe.eth.limo (requires bring your own RPC)
- **Local**: Can be downloaded and run locally

#### Setup

1. Select network and enter an RPC URL
   ![Eternal Safe network selection](./assets/eternal-safe-network-selection.png)
2. Enter Safe address and load
   ![Eternal Safe address entry](./assets/eternal-safe-address-entry.png)
3. Eternal Safe will automatically detect Ether balances but not ERC20 tokens. They can be added manually

#### Transaction Verification

**Critical**: It is still essential to verify hashes and calldata from Eternal Safe. Follow the verification steps in [Transaction Verification & Signing](./transaction-verification-and-signing.md).

#### Smart Link System

Once a transaction has been signed by one signer, a **Smart Link** is created which can be forwarded to the next signer to add their signature. The transactions do not go to any centralized backend.

**Example Smart Link:**
```
Please sign this Eternal Safe transaction for the Safe: base:0xA79C6968E3c75aE4eF388370d1f142720D498fEC. 
Current confirmations: 1 of 2.

```

#### Execution

Once all signatures are collected, execute the transaction. **Note**: Prior to execution you can manually simulate using Tenderly by entering the transaction data, but an automatic simulation link will not be available.

## Solana

### Squads Public Client - Open source Squads V4 interface

#### Access Options
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/public-v4-client
- **Hosted**: https://backup.app.squads.so/
- **Features**: Verifiable build, self-hostable with Docker, IPFS distribution
- **Local**: Can be built and run locally

#### Setup

1. If running locally, follow setup instructions in https://github.com/Squads-Protocol/public-v4-client and access via http://localhost:8080
2. Enter RPC URL in settings
   ![Squads RPC configuration](./assets/squads-rpc-configuration.png)
3. Enter multisig address in the **lower** text box (Search for Multisig Config) and select the detected Multisig Config
   ![Squads multisig selection](./assets/squads-multisig-selection.png)

#### Transaction Operations

4. Create, approve, or execute transactions. *Smart Links* are not needed for Solana as all transactions are on chain and accessible via the RPC without an API

## Security Considerations

### Enhanced Verification

When using backup systems:
- **Extra caution required**: Be more thorough with verification procedures
- **Multiple verification methods**: Use additional tools to cross-check transaction details
- **Team confirmation**: Verify with other signers before proceeding with critical transactions
- **Documentation**: Record use of backup systems and any issues encountered

### Risk Assessment

- **Delay non-critical operations**: Consider postponing non-urgent transactions until primary systems recover
- **Emergency operations only**: For critical emergency responses, proceed with enhanced verification
- **Communication**: Keep team informed about system status and verification procedures

## Testing and Preparation

### Regular Practice
- **Monthly testing**: Practice using backup interfaces during normal operations
- **Team coordination**: Ensure all signers can operate backup systems
- **Process documentation**: Update procedures based on practice sessions

### Emergency Drills
- **Simulated outages**: Practice coordinating with backup systems during drills
- **Communication testing**: Verify backup communication channels work with backup UIs
- **Time measurement**: Track how long backup system activation takes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **RPC connectivity**: Switch to alternative RPC providers if connection fails
- **Transaction loading**: Refresh or try different network endpoints
- **Signature verification**: Use multiple verification tools when in doubt

### Support Resources
- **GitHub documentation**: Refer to project documentation for technical issues
- **Team assistance**: Coordinate with other signers for problem-solving
- **Alternative tools**: Have multiple backup options available
