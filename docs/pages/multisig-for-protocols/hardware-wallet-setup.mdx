# Hardware Wallet Setup

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Recommended devices

**Ledger:**
- Ledger Stax
- Ledger Nano S Plus

**Trezor:**
- Trezor Model One
- Trezor Safe 3

## Initial setup

### Purchase & Verification
- Purchase only from manufacturer or authorized resellers
- Verify tamper-resistant packaging is untouched
- Check for authenticity indicators on packaging

### Device configuration
- Update firmware to latest version before creating accounts
- Configure PIN - Use unique, strong PIN (different from other devices)
- Generate seed following device instructions
- Create accounts as needed

## Backup device

Every signer MUST maintain a backup device. If the first device fails it is better to have a second one ready to go without having to access the seed phrase.
- Second hardware wallet with same seed phrase
- Test both devices can create valid signatures
- Store backup securely
- Monthly verification that backup device functions correctly
