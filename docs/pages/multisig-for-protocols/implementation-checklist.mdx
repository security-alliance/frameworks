### Personal Security

- [ ] I have enabled 2FA on all accounts with approved methods (YubiKey preferred) per [Personal Security (OpSec)](/multisig-for-protocols/personal-security-opsec)
- [ ] I use dedicated devices or accounts for multisig operations when required
- [ ] I have implemented travel security procedures appropriate for my risk level
- [ ] I understand incident reporting procedures for security concerns

### Compliance

- [ ] I have read and understand all sections of this security framework
- [ ] I understand my specific role requirements based on multisig classification
- [ ] I know how to properly offboard when leaving a multisig role per [Offboarding](/multisig-for-protocols/offboarding)
- [ ] I commit to following these security procedures and reporting any deviations

## Specialized Training by Use Case
