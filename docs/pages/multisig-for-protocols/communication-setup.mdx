# Communication Setup

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Primary channel

Set up dedicated communication channel for multisig operations:

- **Platform**: Signal recommended (end-to-end encryption)
- **Membership**: Multisig signers + authorized management only
- **Configuration**: Notifications enabled, disappearing messages for sensitive discussions
- **Naming**: Clear channel naming convention (e.g., "X-Treasury-Multisig")

## Backup channels

Configure backup communication on different platform:

- **Platform**: Different from primary (if Signal primary, use Telegram/Discord/Slack)
- **Same membership restrictions** as primary
- **Document access procedures** for all signers

## Paging system (Critical/Emergency Multisigs)

For multisigs requiring rapid response:

- Configure alerts that can reach signers 24/7
- Include essential info in page: multisig name, urgency level, primary action needed
- Link to emergency runbooks in notification message
- Test quarterly to ensure reliability
