# Use Case Specific Requirements

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Treasury Multisigs

### Key requirements:
- **Allowance module** required for all msigs (see [Section 3.2](/multisig-for-protocols/setup-and-configuration#modules--guards))

## Emergency response Multisigs

### Training & Drills:
- Bi-annual paging system tests to verify alert functionality
- Annual full emergency simulation with all signers

### Additional requirements:
- Geographic distribution encouraged for 24/7 coverage
- 24/7 availability for threshold number of signers

## Capital allocation Multisigs

### Operational constraints:
- Encourage on-chain constraints wherever possible (smart contract limits, parameter bounds)
- Protocol expertise required for all signers

## Smart contract control Multisigs

### On-chain constraints:
- [**Timelock contracts**](#timelock-configuration) for major changes (upgrades, significant parameter changes)
- Parameter limits enforced by smart contracts where feasible

### Threshold considerations:
- Higher thresholds for contract upgrades (consider 7/9+)
- Lower thresholds acceptable for highly constrained operations (rate setting with bounds and a backup recovery mechanism to replace the multisig)

## Timelock Configuration

For sensitive protocol operations like configuration changes or upgrades it is recommended to use a timelock contract (ex. [OpenZeppelin Timelock Controller](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/governance#TimelockController)) to stage transactions on-chain for final verification before execution. It is not necessary to have a long delay. Some timelock contracts are even configured with 0 delay. The key is to have the full transaction payload fully on chain after signature with a final opportunity to review it and cancel it.

### Configuration

When using a timelock contract the timelock address will be set as the owner or role-holder for the protocol contract.
The Safe will be the sole contract that has the Proposer role on the timelock contract.
The Safe, or an address of a multisig signer, or other desired EOA can be set as the canceller or executor on the timelock contract.
By default the timelock contract is set to be its own admin. This means that any changes to timelock contract roles also go through the timelock stage.

### Simulation Consideration

When using a timelock the simulation for the multisig transaction will not show the execution of the transaction but instead the addition of the pending transaction to the timelock. The pending transaction can be simulated manually as shown in [Simulation testing](/multisig-for-protocols/transaction-verification-and-signing#2-simulation-testing).
