# Introduction to Frameworks


Welcome to the Security Frameworks by Security Alliance (SEAL), a curated resource for those seeking knowledge in the realm of blockchain security. Our organization, a collective of dedicated security specialists, is on a mission to spread awareness and educate the community about best practices and potential pitfalls in Web3 security.

## Why We Created This Resource

We have noticed a growing need to address the various challenges and issues facing our field, some of which include security threats not specifically aimed at Web3 infrastructure. Recognizing that information is abundant but not always easily accessible, we've compiled and organized existing resources from around the internet and generated new content specifically with this purpose in mind.

## Who Can Benefit

Regardless of your background—whether in Web2, Web3, or beyond—these guidelines are open to all who seek to learn and contribute. We aim to establish a comprehensive, high-level security framework for Web3 projects, providing best practices to development teams throughout the lifecycle of their projects. Consider this a one-stop shop for everything related to Web3 security.

## Who We Are

SEAL is a not-for-profit organization committed to enhancing security awareness, education, and specialized work as a public good for the Web3 ecosystem, its supporting technologies, and communities. Our efforts are driven by a shared desire to foster a safer, more informed digital landscape. We do this by designing innovative projects, engaging elite technologists, and coordinating on the social layer to ensure meaningful adoption.
