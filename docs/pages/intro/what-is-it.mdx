# What Is It

This resource is a collection of best practices written in an abstract or general fashion to be applicable regardless of
the specific technology. It serves as a comprehensive guide to help you secure various aspects of your Web3 projects
and build resilience against potential threats.

This guide aims to centralize existing information, so you might not see novel features but rather a well-organized
compilation of security-related topics, from simpler ones to more complex ones. The goal is to provide a comprehensive
resource that brings together diverse security insights and practices into one accessible place.

Our hope is that these resources will help expand your security skill set.
