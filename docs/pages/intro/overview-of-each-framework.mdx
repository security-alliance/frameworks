# Overview of Each Framework

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />

> **Important Disclaimer**: The frameworks presented in this documentation are living documents that evolve with the

> threats, new best practices, and community feedback. We recommend regularly checking for updates to ensure you're
> working with the most current security guidelines.

This document provides an overview of the various frameworks covered in the Security Frameworks by SEAL. Each framework
addresses a specific aspect of Web3 security, providing best practices and guidelines to help secure your projects.

## Community Management

This framework explores best practices for securing and managing online communities associated with Web3 projects,
covering platforms like Discord, Twitter, Telegram, and Google. It focuses on establishing secure communication channels
and community guidelines.

## Awareness

This section covers strategies for fostering security awareness among team members and users of Web3 projects, including
understanding threat vectors, cultivating a security-aware mindset, and staying informed about security developments.

## Operational Security (OpSec)

This comprehensive framework addresses day-to-day security practices for Web3 teams, covering fundamentals, governance,
risk management, control domains, lifecycle management, monitoring, incident response, and continuous improvement.

## Wallet Security

This section delves into the crucial aspect of managing cryptographic keys in Web3 projects, discussing various wallet
types (cold vs hot, custodial vs non-custodial), hardware wallets, signing schemes, and software wallets.

## External Security Reviews

This framework provides guidance on conducting and preparing for external security audits and reviews, including setting
expectations, preparation, security policies, and vendor selection.

## Vulnerability Disclosure

This section discusses best practices for handling and disclosing vulnerabilities in Web3 projects, including
establishing security contacts and managing bug bounty programs.

## Infrastructure

This section covers the fundamental aspects of securing the underlying infrastructure of Web3 projects, including asset
inventory, cloud infrastructure, DDoS protection, DNS security, IAM, network security, and zero-trust principles.

## Monitoring

This framework discusses the importance of continuous monitoring in Web3 projects, focusing on setting up effective
monitoring systems and defining appropriate thresholds for alerts.

## Front-End/Web Application

This section addresses security considerations specific to the user-facing components of Web3 projects, including both
web and mobile application security, common vulnerabilities, and security tools.

## Incident Management

This section outlines protocols for handling security incidents, including communication strategies, detection and
response procedures, lessons learned, and playbooks, including specific guidelines for SEAL 911 War Room.

## Threat Modeling

This framework provides guidance on creating and maintaining threat models, as well as identifying and mitigating
potential threats to Web3 projects.

## DevSecOps

This framework focuses on integrating security practices into the development and operations processes, covering code
signing, CI/CD, IDE security, repository hardening, and security testing.

## Privacy

This section explores tools and practices for maintaining privacy in the Web3 ecosystem, including secure browsing, data
removal, digital footprint management, encrypted communication, and privacy-focused operating systems.

## Supply Chain

This framework addresses the security implications of dependencies and third-party components in Web3 projects,
including dependency awareness and supply chain levels for software artifacts.

## Identity and Access Management (IAM)

This framework covers best practices for managing user identities and access control in Web3 projects, including
role-based access control and secure authentication.

## Secure Software Development

This section focuses on integrating security practices throughout the software development lifecycle, including secure
coding standards, code reviews, and secure design principles.

## Security Testing

This framework explores various methods of testing Web3 projects for security vulnerabilities, including dynamic and
static application security testing, fuzz testing, and security regression testing.

## ENS

This section covers Ethereum Name Service security considerations, including data integrity, cross-chain compatibility,
smart contract integration, interface compliance, and name handling.

## Safe Harbor

This framework provides guidance on establishing safe harbor protocols for security researchers, including key terms,
protocols, technical outlines, and whitehat guidelines.

## Encryption

This comprehensive section covers various encryption methods and their applications in protecting data, including cloud
data encryption, communication encryption, database encryption, and various types of storage encryption.
