# How to Navigate the Website

Navigating the Security Frameworks by SEAL will be designed, in time, to be intuitive and
user-friendly. We currently allow users to filter contents by role, but we're not quite there yet.
Any feedback on how to improve the usage of frameworks in the future is appreciated.

## Categories

The content is organized into different categories, each focusing on a specific aspect of security.
Currently, we are under the introduction section, but you can explore the broader category of
"Frameworks" below. Each framework is categorized to help you find relevant information quickly.

## Filtering by Profile

This is currently being implemented, and we're currently looking for volunteers and collaborators
for this specific task. The main objective is to allow users to filter the content by profile
to focus on information relevant to their role within the organization. This feature allows them to
bypass unnecessary reading and concentrate on what matters most.

Example roles:

- Developer
- Executive
- Security
- Finance
- Crypto
- Management
- Community
- Non-Technical

This targeted approach will ensure you get the most relevant information efficiently.
