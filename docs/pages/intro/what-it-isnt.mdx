# What It Isn't

This resource isn't just a compilation of existing information. While it may initially seem like a collection of curated
content, its primary focus is on providing in-depth, practical guidance.

Unlike other curations, compilations, or blog posts that often focus on the latest technologies, this guide delves into
underlying concepts and technical aspects essential for securing Web3 projects. Itâ€™s not meant to be read like a "story"
but rather used as a reference to enhance your understanding and application of security practices.

The content may not always follow the latest state-of-the-art technologies, as its focus is on fundamental security
principles that are broadly applicable. Our aim is to provide valuable insights and practical advice to help you secure
your projects effectively.

This guide is not intended to be offensive, though it might include strong examples to illustrate particular points. Our
goal is to ensure clarity and effectiveness in conveying security best practices.
