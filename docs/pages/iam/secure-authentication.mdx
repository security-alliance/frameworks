# Secure Authentication

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Secure authentication is essential for verifying the identity of team members and ensuring that only authorized individuals have access. By implementing strong authentication mechanisms you can protect your project against unauthorized access and lower the risk for potential security breaches.

## Key Authentication Methods

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require multiple forms of verification (e.g., something you know, something you have, something you are) to enhance security. It is strongly suggested that one does not use SMS as a form of multi-factor authentication, but instead utilizes hardware tokens such as Yubikeys.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Enable SSO in services you use to allow team members to authenticate once and gain access to multiple systems without re-entering credentials, but make sure that the account connected to SSO is secured by strong Multi-Factor Authentication.
- **Password Management**: Enforce strong password policies and encourage the use of password managers to generate and store complex passwords.

## Best Practices for Secure Authentication

1. Require MFA for all team members, especially for accessing sensitive systems and data. Encourage the use of hardware tokens (e.g., Yubikeys) over SMS-based MFA.
2. Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious authentication attempts, such as repeated failed logins or logins from unusual locations.
3. Provide training on secure authentication practices and the importance of protecting authentication credentials.
