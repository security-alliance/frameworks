# Devcontainers & Secure Development Environments

Secure development environments reduce the risk of compromise when working with untrusted or unpredictable code. This guide focuses on practical sandboxing strategies using Devcontainers, Codespaces, and secure browser practices.

## Why Secure Development Environments Matter

Developers often hold high-value access:

- SSH keys and access tokens
- Private codebases
- CI/CD systems
- Deployment pipelines

A compromise on a single developer machine can escalate into a full organization breach.

## Running Untrusted Code Safely

Even source code can execute malicious behavior — during install, build, or developer tooling automation.

### Common Risk Scenarios

1. **Recruitment Scams**  
   Fake assignments designed to steal credentials or implant malware.

2. **Malicious Dependencies**  
   Supply-chain attacks via typosquatting or compromised packages that run hidden install or build scripts.

3. Auto-Executing Tooling
IDEs, language servers, or build systems that automatically run code when a project is opened or dependencies are installed.

4. Embedded Setup Scripts
Convenience helpers like setup.sh or Docker build steps that assume trust and are often executed without review.

5. Git Hook Abuse
Hidden automation in .git/hooks or .husky/ that triggers on clone, commit, or push to hijack SSH or exfiltrate tokens.

> When in doubt: isolate first, inspect second, execute last.

## Local Isolation: Devcontainers

Devcontainers provide a reproducible environment using Docker sandboxing.

### Benefits  
- Filesystem isolation  
- Consistent tooling  
- Disposable environments  

### Caveats  
- Misconfigured containers may share host network or secrets

### Before You Run a Devcontainer

- Review `.devcontainer.json` for:
  - Root privilege use
  - Host mounts
  - Docker-in-Docker access
  - Secret exposures
- Prefer trusted base images
- Disable unneeded networking (`--network=none`) when possible

> For in-depth configuration: see [Devcontainer Security](./devcontainer-security.mdx)

Frameworks provides a hardened default devcontainer to standardize secure development.

## Cloud Isolation: Codespaces

Codespaces extend devcontainers into cloud-hosted secure environments.

- Stronger isolation from host machine  
- Ideal for evaluating unknown contributors or external code  
- Simple to reset to a clean state after use  

See comparison of GitHub Codespaces, Coder, GitPod and DevPod [here](https://www.vcluster.com/blog/comparing-coder-vs-codespaces-vs-gitpod-vs-devpod).

> If you can’t trust the code, don’t run it locally.

## Browser Security for Developers

Browsers and extensions are prime targets for credential theft and wallet compromise.

**Best Practices**

- Use a **separate browser or profile** for development
- Disable or isolate sensitive extensions
- If blockchain wallets are required:
  - Use a **development-only** wallet
  - Never store real value assets in dev environments

If separation isn’t possible:
- Use Incognito mode with extensions disabled
