# Secure Development Environments

Secure development environments reduce the risk of compromise when working with untrusted or unpredictable code. This guide focuses on practical sandboxing strategies using Devcontainers, Codespaces, and secure browser practices.

## Why Secure Development Environments Matter

Developers often hold high-value access:

- SSH keys and access tokens
- Private codebases
- CI/CD systems
- Deployment pipelines

A compromise on a single developer machine can escalate into a full organization breach.

### Common Risk Scenarios

1. **Recruitment Scams:** Fake assignments designed to steal credentials or implant malware.

2. **Malicious Dependencies:** Supply-chain attacks via typosquatting or compromised packages that run hidden install or build scripts.

3. **Auto-Executing Tooling:** IDEs, language servers, or build systems that automatically run code when a project is opened or dependencies are installed.

4. **Embedded Setup Scripts:** Convenience helpers like setup.sh or Docker build steps that assume trust and are often executed without review.

5. **Git Hook Abuse:** Hidden automation in .git/hooks or .husky/ that triggers on clone, commit, or push to hijack SSH or exfiltrate tokens.

> When in doubt: isolate first, inspect second, execute last.

## Running Untrusted Code Safely

Even source code can execute malicious behavior — during install, build, or developer tooling automation.

| Scenario | Risk Level | Isolation Method |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recruitment Assignment | High | Codespace or VM |
| Testing established open-source library | Medium | Devcontainer |
| Running internal company code | Low | Devcontainer / Standard Environment |

### Local Isolation

#### Devcontainers

Devcontainers provide a reproducible environment using Docker sandboxing.

**Benefits**  

- Filesystem isolation  
- Consistent tooling  
- Disposable & fully reproducible environments  

**Caveats**  

- Misconfigured containers may share host network or secrets

**Before You Run a Devcontainer**

- Review `.devcontainer.json` for:
  - Root privilege use
  - Host mounts
  - Docker-in-Docker access
  - Secret exposures
- Prefer trusted base images
- Disable unneeded networking (`--network=none`) when possible

> For in-depth configuration: see [Devcontainer Security](./devcontainer-security.mdx)

Frameworks provides a hardened default devcontainer to standardize secure development.

#### Userspace Isolation

Userspace isolation tools like firejail or bubblewrap can sandbox processes without full containerization. They operate using Linux namespace and seccomp filtering, resulting in lower overhead and faster setup.

```bash
# https://firejail.wordpress.com/documentation-2/firefox-guide/
# 
# Launches a "fresh install" of Firefox with no access to local files,
# no system access, custom DNS, and no saved data. 
firejail --private --dns=1.1.1.1 --dns=9.9.9.9 firefox -no-remote

# Launches a "work" profile with write-access to the ~/work directory for
# a persistent isolated profile. 
firejail --private=/home/username/work firefox -no-remote
```

**Benefits**

- Filesystem isolation
- Network isolation
- Lower overhead than full containers

**Caveats**

- Non-reproducible environments
- More complex for repeated use
- Requires Linux host

**Best Practices**

- Use to quickly sandbox untrusted scripts or tools
- Before running ensure maximal isolation is enabled

#### Virtual Machines

For maximum local isolation, consider virtual machines using tools like VirtualBox or VMware. VMs provide full kernel and hardware isolation at the cost of higher resource usage. Software running inside a VM has no access to the host system unless explicitly shared, and VMs can be easily reset to a clean state.

For particularly sensitive environments, consider using dedicated hardware or a VM hypervisor like Qubes OS that enforce strong compartmentalization between different tasks.

**Benefits**

- Full Kernel Isolation
- Strong, explicit security boundaries
- Disposable environments

**Caveats**

- High resource usage
- Slower setup and teardown

**Best Practices**

- Use for highly sensitive or untrusted code, especially from unknown and unverified sources

### Cloud Isolation: Codespaces

Codespaces extend devcontainers into cloud-hosted secure environments. They make it much easier to run untrusted code without risking local machine compromise compared to VMs or hardware isolation.

- Stronger isolation from host machine  
- Ideal for evaluating unknown contributors or external code  
- Simple to reset to a clean state after use  

See comparison of GitHub Codespaces, Coder, GitPod and DevPod [here](https://www.vcluster.com/blog/comparing-coder-vs-codespaces-vs-gitpod-vs-devpod).

> If you can’t trust the code, don’t run it locally.

## Browser Security for Developers

Browsers and extensions are prime targets for credential theft and wallet compromise.

**Best Practices**

- Use a **separate browser or profile** for development
  - Consider using a dedicated browser install or a userspace-isolated profile with Firejail/Bubblewrap
- Disable or isolate sensitive extensions
- If blockchain wallets are required:
  - Use a **development-only** wallet
  - Never store real value assets in dev environments

## Example Profiles

### Frontend Developer

Focuses on frontend applications with moderate risk. Requires access to a backend API and deployment pipelines.

- **Development:** Use Codespaces or Devcontainers for reproducible and isolated environments while developing.
- **Backend Access:** Use development-only credentials stored in a basic [secret manager](./secret-management.mdx) or environment variables.
- **Browser:** Use any browser profile with extensions disabled when they may impact site rendering.
- **Deployment:** Automated deployments via CI/CD with no production database access.

### Fullstack Developer

Focuses on both frontend and backend development. Requires write access to the database and deployment systems.

- **Development:** Use Codespaces or Devcontainers to isolate development environments.
- **Backend Access:** Develop against a local or staging database. Use a [secret manager](./secret-management.mdx) for sensitive credentials.
- **Deployment:** Deploy via CI/CD pipelines with no direct production database or production access.

### Smart Contract Developer

Focuses on blockchain and smart contract development. Requires access to test networks and wallet management.

- **Development:** Use Codespaces or Devcontainers for isolated environments.
- **Wallets:** Use development-only wallets with no real assets.
- **Chain:** Use testnet or local forks like Anvil to avoid leaking data.
- **Deployment:** Deploy smart contracts from a production-only account via CI/CD or a deployer multisig.

### Security Researcher

Analyzes untrusted code, libraries, or dependencies. May actively handle malicious code, so requires maximum isolation to prevent host compromise.

- **Development:** Use cloud Codespaces or local VMs for maximum isolation with snapshot capability.
- **Network:** Disable network access when analyzing malware or use isolated network segments.
- **Browser:** Use isolated browser within Codespace or VM; never use personal browser.
- **Credentials:** Never use real credentials, tokens, or SSH keys in analysis environments.
