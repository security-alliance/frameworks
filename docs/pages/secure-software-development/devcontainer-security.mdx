  - title: "Check host mounts"
    description: >
      Ensure the container only mounts your workspace.  
      No access to sensitive host paths like `/`, `/home`, `.ssh`, or `/var/run/docker.sock`.

  - title: "Network Isolation"
    description: >
      By default fully isolate devcontainers from the network. If network access is required, 
      alloy only specific hosts or ports, avoid LAN access, and avoid binding container ports 
      to the host.

  - title: "Inspect setup scripts"
    description: >
      Review `Dockerfile`, `devcontainer.json`, and any post-create commands.  
      Look for unsafe commands such as `sudo`, `--privileged`, or `curl | bash`.

  - title: "Verify base image"
    description: >
      Confirm the base image is from a trusted source and pinned to a version or digest.  
      Avoid unverified or `latest` tags.

  - title: "Run as non-root"
    description: >
      The container should run as a normal user (like `vscode` or `developer`), not as root.

  - title: "Use isolation"
    description: >
      If uncertain, open untrusted repositories in remote or disposable environments  
      (e.g., Codespaces, sandbox VMs) rather than your main machine.

# Devcontainer Security Checklist

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

While devcontainers can improve security, a maliciously or incorrectly configured devcontainer can still break the sandbox and access your system.  When using pre-built devcontainers you should always inspect the `.devcontainer.json` before running.  Did you check frameworks' devcontainer?

<BenchmarkList benchmarks={frontmatter.benchmarks} />

For more information on devcontainer security, consider reviewing other [security](https://some-natalie.dev/blog/securing-devcontainers) [checklists](https://www.sentinelone.com/cybersecurity-101/cloud-security/container-security-checklist/#the-10-key-container-security-checklists), or use [theredguild's devcontainer](https://github.com/theredguild/devcontainer) as a starting point for your own.
