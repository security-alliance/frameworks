  - title: "Check host mounts"
    description: >
      Ensure the container only mounts your workspace.  
      No access to sensitive host paths like `/`, `/home`, `.ssh`, or `/var/run/docker.sock`. 
      If network access or host paths are required, they should be opened on a case-by-case basis. 

  - title: "Inspect setup scripts"
    description: >
      Review `Dockerfile`, `devcontainer.json`, and any post-create commands.  
      Look for unsafe commands such as `sudo`, `--privileged`, or `curl | bash`.

  - title: "Verify base image"
    description: >
      Confirm the base image is from a trusted source and pinned to a version or digest.  
      Avoid unverified or `latest` tags.

  - title: "Run as non-root"
    description: >
      The container should run as a normal user (like `vscode` or `developer`), not as root.

  - title: "Use isolation"
    description: >
      If uncertain, open untrusted repositories in remote or disposable environments  
      (e.g., Codespaces, sandbox VMs) rather than your main machine.

# Devcontainer Security Checklist

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

While devcontainers can improve security, a maliciously or incorrectly configured devcontainer can still break the sandbox and access your system.  When using pre-built devcontainers you should always inspect the `.devcontainer.json` before running.  Did you check frameworks' devcontainer?
