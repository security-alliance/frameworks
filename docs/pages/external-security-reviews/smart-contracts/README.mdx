# Smart Contract Security Reviews

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Smart contract security reviews are specialized assessments focused on identifying vulnerabilities in blockchain-based smart contracts and protocols. These reviews are critical for web3 projects due to the immutable nature of blockchain deployments and the high-value targets that smart contracts often represent.

## Why Smart Contract Security Reviews Are Critical

Smart contracts operate in a unique environment that makes security paramount:

- **Immutability**: Once deployed, smart contracts cannot be easily changed
- **Financial Risk**: Smart contracts often handle significant value in cryptocurrencies
- **Public Accessibility**: All code and transactions are visible on the blockchain
- **Adversarial Environment**: Attackers are incentivized by potential financial gains
- **Complex Interactions**: DeFi protocols involve intricate interactions between multiple contracts

According to industry data, billions of dollars have been lost due to smart contract vulnerabilities, making security reviews essential for protecting user funds and maintaining protocol integrity.

## Smart Contract Security Review Process

A security review engagement is typically divided into four phases:

- **Scoping Phase**: The project team prepares the codebase and defines specific scope for security researchers
- **Initial Assessment Phase**: Researchers conduct preliminary analysis to identify potential security issues
- **Mitigation Phase**: The team works on fixing identified issues with ongoing auditor support
- **Final Report Phase**: Auditors review implemented fixes and provide a comprehensive final report

### Audit Methodologies

- **Static Analysis**: Automated code scanning for known vulnerability patterns
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Runtime testing and fuzzing
- **Manual Review**: Expert analysis of business logic and complex vulnerabilities
- **Formal Verification**: Mathematical proofs of contract correctness (where applicable)

## Types of Smart Contract Audits

### Private Audits

- Dedicated security researchers assigned to your project
- Confidential and personalized attention
- Higher cost but comprehensive coverage
- Direct communication with audit team

### Public/Competitive Audits

- Multiple researchers competing for prizes
- Diverse perspectives and approaches
- More cost-effective option
- Broader coverage through competition
