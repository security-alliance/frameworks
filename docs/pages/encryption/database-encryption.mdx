Often, databases contains information that should not be publicly available. In order to protect your database, you may consider implementing the following best practices:

## Best Practices

1. Use strong encryption algorithms to encrypt database files and backups.
2. Encrypt sensitive columns within the database, such as those containing personally identifiable information (PII).
3. Use Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) to automatically encrypt and decrypt data stored in the database.
4. Implement robust key management practices, including the use of HSMs and regular key rotation depending on your use case.
5. Enforce strict access controls to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data.
