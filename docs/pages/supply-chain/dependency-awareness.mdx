# Dependency Awareness

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />

Dependency awareness is the practice of understanding and managing all the external libraries, frameworks, and
components that a software project relies on. Dependencies can introduce vulnerabilities and risks, which means it's
important to keep track of them and ensure they are secure.

## Importance of Dependency Awareness

1. **Security Risks**
   - Dependencies can contain vulnerabilities that may be exploited by threat actors.

2. **Compliance**
   - Ensuring that dependencies comply with licensing and regulatory requirements is essential to avoid legal issues.

3. **Maintainability**
   - Understanding dependencies and their impact on the project will help understand if it's possible to update a
   dependency used by your application.

## Best Practices for Dependency Awareness

1. **Use Dependency Management Tools**
   - Leverage tools that can automatically track and manage dependencies. Examples include:
     - **Web2:**
       - **Snyk:** Monitors and fixes vulnerabilities in dependencies.
       - **Dependabot:** Automatically updates dependencies in GitHub projects.
     - **Solidity:**
       - **Ethlint:** Analyzes and lints Solidity code, including dependencies.
       - **MythX:** Scans for vulnerabilities in smart contract dependencies.

2. **Regularly Update Dependencies**
   - Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions after verifying them.

3. **Monitor for Vulnerabilities**
   - Continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like Snyk, npm audit, and GitHub Security
   Alerts.

4. **Audit Dependencies**
   - Perform regular audits of dependencies to ensure they are necessary and secure. Remove unused or outdated
   dependencies.

5. **Use Trusted Sources**
   - Only use dependencies from trusted and reputable sources. Avoid using unverified or poorly maintained libraries.
