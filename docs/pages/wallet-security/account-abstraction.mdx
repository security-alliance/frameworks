# Account Abstraction Wallets

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## User Profile

Advanced users, developers, and organizations interested in programmable security, customizable transaction rules, and
moving beyond the limitations of standard Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) to eliminate single points of failure like
seed phrase loss.

## Primary Goal

To leverage the power of smart contracts at the account level, enabling features like social recovery, gas sponsorship,
batch transactions, and flexible security policies that are not possible with an EOA.

## Core Concept: ERC-4337

Account Abstraction (AA) turns a user's account into a smart contract, making it programmable. Instead of being
controlled directly by a single private key, the account's logic is defined by its code. This is achieved through
**ERC-4337**, a standard that enables AA without requiring changes to the core Ethereum protocol. It introduces a
higher-level pseudo-transaction system with several key components:

* **Smart Contract Account**: The user's wallet itself is a smart contract, containing custom logic for validating
transactions.
* **UserOperation**: A data structure that bundles the user's intent, calldata, and signature. This object is sent to a
dedicated, alternative mempool.
* **Bundlers**: Specialized nodes that package multiple `UserOperation` objects from the mempool into a single
transaction and submit it to the `EntryPoint` contract.
* **EntryPoint**: A singleton smart contract that acts as the central orchestrator. It verifies and executes the bundled
`UserOperations`, ensuring that accounts and paymasters have sufficient funds to pay for gas.
* **Paymasters**: Optional smart contracts that can sponsor gas fees on behalf of the user, enabling gasless
transactions for the end-user or allowing fees to be paid in ERC-20 tokens.

## Key Benefits & Features

* **Enhanced Security**:
  * **Social Recovery**: Mitigate the risk of losing a primary key by designating trusted "guardians" (other accounts or
  devices) who can collectively approve an account recovery.
  * **Customizable Policies**: Implement robust security rules directly into the wallet, such as daily spending limits,
  whitelisting trusted contracts, or requiring multisig confirmation for transactions over a certain value.

* **Improved User Experience**:
  * **Gasless Transactions**: Enjoy a smoother experience where dApps can sponsor gas fees, or pay for transactions
  using ERC-20 tokens instead of needing the chain's native asset (e.g., ETH).
  * **Simplified Interactions**: Perform complex, multi-step actions (like `approve` and `swap`) in a single, atomic
  transaction, reducing clicks and potential points of failure.

## Security Considerations & Best Practices

* **Smart Contract Risk**: The security of an AA wallet is entirely dependent on the quality and security of its
underlying smart contract code. Bugs or vulnerabilities in the account's implementation can lead to a total loss of
funds. **Thorough audits of the account logic are non-negotiable.**
* **Guardian Selection and Security**: The strength of the social recovery model depends on the security and
independence of the guardians. They should be diverse and not susceptible to a single common threat.
* **EntryPoint Centralization**: The `EntryPoint` contract is a central trust point for the entire ERC-4337 ecosystem. A
vulnerability in the official `EntryPoint` could have widespread consequences. Use only the canonical, heavily audited
`EntryPoint` contract.
* **Paymaster and Factory Security**: Malicious or poorly coded Paymasters and Factories can introduce DoS vectors or
other risks. The ERC-4337 standard includes a reputation system and staking mechanisms to throttle or ban misbehaving
entities, but users should only interact with trusted and audited Paymasters.
* **Gas Overhead**: The added logic in a smart contract account means that transactions can be more expensive than those
from a standard EOA. This trade-off between features and cost should be considered, though it can be offset by gas
sponsorship.
* **Key Revocation**: If the primary signing key is compromised, the recovery process allows you to swap it out for a
new one without having to move all assets to a new wallet address.
* **Advanced Guardian Setups**: For enhanced security, guardian roles can be implemented using **Multi-Party Computation
(MPC)**. In an MPC-based recovery, guardians hold cryptographic shares that are used collectively to authorize a
recovery action. This method allows guardians to produce a valid signature through a distributed computation using their
individual shares, without ever reconstructing a single master key on any device.
