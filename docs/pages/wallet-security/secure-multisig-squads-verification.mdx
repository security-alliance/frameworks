# Squads Multisig: Step-by-Step Verification
Limited tooling is available for Solana verification compared to EVM. Exercise extra caution and cross-verify with team members.

## Workflow

1) Initial Proposal (SOL transfer, token transfer, signer/threshold change)

2) Simulation

- Squads UI provides a simulation link after first signature
- Simulation is helpful for transfers; configuration changes often fail, but you can still inspect data via explorer

## SOL Transfer Verification

- Use explorer simulation to view System Program Instruction
- Interpret instruction bytes; convert lamports to SOL (1e9)

## USDS Transfer Verification

- Review Associated Token Program and Token Program instruction
- Interpret bytes; confirm decimals and amounts

## Configuration Change Verification

- Use the transaction account page; open first transaction in history
- Expand Squads Multisig Program: Config Transaction Create to inspect decoded data

## Signing & Execution

- Sign (do not execute) and confirm expected hash on Ledger
- Execute after collecting all signatures
