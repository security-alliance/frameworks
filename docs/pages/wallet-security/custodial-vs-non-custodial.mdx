# Custodial vs. Non-Custodial Wallets

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

The distinction between custodial and non-custodial wallets centers on who controls the private keys. This control directly impacts ownership, security responsibility, and the ability to interact with the web3 ecosystem.

## Custodial Wallets

### What Are They?

Custodial wallets are managed by a third party, such as a centralized exchange (CEX) or a dedicated wallet service provider. In this model, the third party holds and manages the private keys on behalf of the user.

### Characteristics

- **Managed Private Keys**: The third party has full control over the private keys. You do not possess them.
- **Recovery Options**:  It is often easier to recover account access if login credentials are lost, as the custodian can assist.
- **Security Dependence**: The security of your assets is entirely dependent on the custodian's security practices, infrastructure, and operational integrity.
- **Ease of Use**: Provides a simpler user experience, abstracting away the complexities of private key management.

### Use Cases

- **New Users/Beginners**: Suitable for users who are new to cryptocurrency and prefer a simpler, managed solution.
- **Convenience Over Control**:  Ideal for users who prioritize convenience and ease of use over full control.

## Non-Custodial Wallets

### What Are They?

Non-custodial (or self-custody) wallets are managed directly by the user, who has sole and complete control over their private keys. The user is entirely responsible for the security, backup, and management of these keys.

### Characteristics

- **User-Controlled Private Keys**: The user has exclusive control and possession of their private keys.
- **Eliminates Counterparty Risk**: Assets are not exposed to the risk of a third-party custodian being hacked, becoming insolvent, or freezing funds. Security becomes dependent on the user's own practices.
- **Full Responsibility**: The user is solely responsible for backing up their seed phrase and securing their private keys. Loss of these keys means irreversible loss of funds.
- **Web3 Interaction**: Enable seamless interaction with dApps.

### Use Cases

- **Experienced Users & Developers**: Preferred by users who understand blockchain and wallet security best practices.
- **Security & Control Prioritization**: Ideal for users who prioritize full control over their assets and are willing to undertake the responsibility of self-custody.
