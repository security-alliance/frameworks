# For Beginners & Small Balances

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## User Profile

A user with foundational web3 knowledge who is actively learning and interacting with dApps. The asset value is
typically non-critical, where a potential loss would not be financially significant. This profile prioritizes **ease of
use** and **learning** over protections against online threats.

## Primary Goal

The primary objective is a low-friction setup for **convenience** and **dApp interaction**. This includes frequent
transactions, exploring DeFi protocols, and engaging with NFTs.

## Recommended Setup

The standard setup for this profile is a **hot wallet**, which provides the necessary internet connectivity for active
use. The most common types are:

* **Browser Extension Wallets:** Integrate directly into a web browser for seamless dApp interaction.
* **Mobile Wallets:** Applications installed on a smartphone, offering convenience and on-the-go access.
* **Desktop Wallets:** Software applications installed on a computer, which can sometimes offer more advanced features
than mobile or browser counterparts.

## Key Considerations & Trade-offs

While convenient, this setup carries inherent risks that the user must understand and accept.

* **Online Threat Vector:** As hot wallets are internet-connected, they are inherently vulnerable to malware and
exploits targeting the browser or operating system.
* **Supply Chain Risk:** It is critical to download wallet software *only* from official, verified sources.

## How to Select a Wallet

When selecting a wallet, prioritize those whose code is **open-source**, as this allows for public scrutiny and
independent verification by the security community. For users who are not developers, several platforms provide
independent analysis to help evaluate a wallet's security.

For example, [Wallet Scrutiny](https://walletscrutiny.com/) focuses on verifying if a wallet's code is verifiably
open-source. Others, like [Wallet Security Ranking](https://www.coinspect.com/wallets/), provide a security score based
on specific criteria such as transaction clarity, protection against known threats, and how it handles dApp permissions.

Using these tools can provide valuable data points to help you assess a wallet's security posture and make an informed
decision.
