Like the rest of Frameworks, SEAL Certifications are open-source and accept contributions from the community.  However, due to the nature of Certifications, contributions are subject to more stringent review and approval processes managed by Isaac, the initiative lead, and the other Certifications maintainers.  

 - If you have suggestions for improving existing Certifications, or ideas for a new Certification, please open an issue in the frameworks repo with the `certifications` tag. We're welcome to feedback and ideas from the community!
 - If you're a protocol interested in having your project certified, you can reach out to us through our [protocol interest form](https://securityalliance.typeform.com/CertsWaitlist). 
 - If you're a security firm interested in becoming a SEAL-approved auditor, please reach out through our [interest form](https://securityalliance.typeform.com/CertsAuditor).

For more information on contributing to SEAL Certifications, or the rest of Frameworks, please see the [Contributing Guide](/contribute/contributing).
