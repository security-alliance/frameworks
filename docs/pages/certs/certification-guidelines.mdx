# Certification Guidelines

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

This document provides guidelines for completing security certification questionnaires. It covers how to score
individual control questions and when to pursue certification through self-assessment or third-party review.

## Scoring Controls

Score each control as:

- **Implemented**: Fully operational with verified evidence  
- **Partially Implemented**: Incomplete or lacks sufficient evidence  
- **Not Implemented**: Control absent  
- **N/A**: Not applicable (provide justification)

## Evidence Collection

For each control scored "Implemented," provide:

- Procedure documentation: Policies, versions, approval dates  
- Operational proof: Logs, records, tickets showing active use, interviews with team members
- Testing/validation: Drill results, incident reports, test outcomes  
- Ownership details: Responsible party, review frequency, last update  
- Technical artifacts: Configurations, screenshots, system exports

## Self-Assessment

The self-assessment option is suitable for organizations wishing to internally validate their security posture.
Self-assessment does not grant official certification, but rather serves as an internal checkpoint to track your
security posture over time.

## Third-Party Review

Third-party reviews are recommended for organizations seeking formal certification, and involve an external
SEAL-certified assessor evaluating your security posture.

### Certification Criteria

Third-party reviewers will issue certification when:

- All controls are "Implemented" or "N/A" with justification  
- Evidence substantiates all claims  
- Overall security posture meets framework requirements

Any controls scored as "Partially Implemented" or "Not Implemented" must be remediated during the review process
before certification can be issued.

### Review Process

1. Complete initial assessment with evidence  
2. Reviewer verifies claims against submitted evidence  
3. Address any findings or requests for additional documentation  
4. Receive certification report with findings and recommendations
