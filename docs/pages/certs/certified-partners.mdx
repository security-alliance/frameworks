SEAL Certification works with a select group of third-party auditing firms to provide certification audits. SEAL-certified auditors have demonstrated expertise in blockchain security and are authorized to conduct audits against SEAL Certifications. 

Auditors that are not SEAL-certified may also perform audits using the SEAL Certifications Framework independantly, but will not be listed here and will not be able to issue SEAL certification attestations.

If your firm is interested in learning more about becoming a SEAL-approved auditor, please reach out through our [interest form](https://securityalliance.typeform.com/CertsAuditor).
