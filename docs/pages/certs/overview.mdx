# SEAL Certification Framework (Certs)

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Certs is a certification framework developed by SEAL to provide standardized guidelines and evaluation criteria for assessing the security of DeFi protocols. Certs provides targeted modular certifications (e.g., [Incident Response](/certs/sfc-incident-response.mdx), [Treasury Ops](/certs/sfc-treasury-ops.mdx)) that can independently validate specific aspects of a protocol's security posture.

Using Certs will help ensure that protocols follow best practices for their security operations, and provides a standard set of criteria for comparing the security of different protocols.

Certs is fully open-source and freely available for any protocol to use.

## How it Works

Certs comprises a set of modular certifications, similar to SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Each certification focuses on a specific area of security and includes controls relevant to that area. Protocols can use certifications independently to evaluate their security posture through self-assessment, or protocols can pursue formal certification through a third-party audit by a SEAL-partnered auditor. After completing a certification with a third-party auditor, protocols can publicly display their certification status and are issued an on-chain badge to demonstrate their completion of the certification.

## Available Certifications

- **[Incident Response](/certs/sfc-incident-response.mdx)** - Detection, response procedures, team coordination, emergency operations
- **[Multisig Ops](/certs/sfc-multisig-ops.mdx)** - Governance, signer security, transaction verification
- **[Treasury Ops](/certs/sfc-treasury-ops.mdx)** - Treasury architecture, transaction security, DeFi risk management
- **[Workspace Security](/certs/sfc-workspace-security.mdx)** - Device security, account management, credential handling
- **[DNS Security](/certs/sfc-dns-registrar.mdx)** - Domain management, DNS configurations, registrar protection

## FAQ

<details>
<summary>What's the difference between self-assessments and certified audits?</summary>

Self-assessments are completed by the protocol team themselves, using the Certs framework as a guide. They are useful for protocols to internally evaluate their own security posture and identify areas for improvement. Self-assessments are not verified by a third party and do not result in a formal certification or an endorsed badge.

Certified audits are completed by a third-party vendor through SEAL's [partner program](/certs/certified-partners.mdx). They involve a thorough and independent evaluation of the protocol's security controls against the Certs framework. Upon successful completion of a certified audit, protocols receive a formal attestation on-chain.

</details>
<details>
<summary>What is an attestation?</summary>

Attestations are certificates issued on-chain through the [Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/standards/tokens/eas/) by SEAL to protocols that successfully complete a certified audit. Attestations serve as verifiable proof that a protocol has met the requirements of a given Certs certification.

Attestations do not indicate that a protocol is completely secure or free from issues. Blockchain security is always evolving and novel vulnerabilities aries regularly. Instead, attestations demonstrate that a protocol has implemented a set of standardized best-practices to manage and mitigate security risks.

</details>
<details>
<summary>What if a protocol doesn't meet all the certification requirements?</summary>

Protocols going through a certified audit that don't meet all the certification requirements will receive a report from the auditor detailing the gaps in their security posture. If the protocol decides to address the gaps, they can work with the auditor to complete a re-assessment of the controls.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What kind of evidence is required?</summary>

Evidence requirements vary by certification and control. Generally, protocols need to provide documentation, screenshots, or other artifacts demonstrating the implementation of each control. This might mean a list of signer addresses for a multisig, incident response playbooks, or screenshots of DNS configurations.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Who can see our attestation?</summary>

Attestations are publicly accessible on-chain through the EAS. The detailed audit reports and evidence provided during the audit process are confidential between the protocol and the auditor. 

</details>
<details>
<summary>Can we use the SEAL logo / badge?</summary>

Protocols that successfully complete a certified audit will receive a badge from SEAL. Protocols are welcome to display this badge on their website or documentation to demonstrate their certification.

</details>
<details>
<summary>Is there a list of certified protocols?</summary>

SEAL maintains a list of protocols that have completed certified audits. You can find the list [here](/certs/certified-protocols.mdx).

</details>
<details>
<summary>Can a project lose their certification?</summary>

Yes, certifications can be revoked if a protocol is found to be non-compliant with the certification requirements for an extended period of time. Certifications are also time-limited and require periodic re-assessment to maintain.
