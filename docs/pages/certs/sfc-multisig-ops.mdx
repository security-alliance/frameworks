    description: Is there a clearly named person or team accountable for multisig
      operations?
    baselines:

        documentation accuracy, periodic reviews, and incident escalation
    title: Named Multisig Operations Owner
  - id: ms-1.1.2
    description: Do you maintain a complete, accurate, and accessible record of all
      your multisigs, their configurations, and their signers?
    baselines:
      - Registry includes address, network, threshold, classification, purpose, signer
        addresses, controlled contracts, on-chain roles, and last review date

  title: Risk Assessment & Management
  controls:
  - id: ms-2.1.1
    description: Do you classify your multisigs by risk level and apply security
      controls proportional to each classification?
    baselines:
      - Classification considers impact factors (financial exposure, protocol
        criticality, reputational risk) and operational needs (response time,
        coordination complexity)
      - Each classification maps to specific required controls (thresholds, quorum
        composition, review cadence)
      - All multisigs must have at least 3 distinct signers with a signing threshold
        of 50% or greater; N-of-N configurations should be avoided
      - Higher-risk classifications require stronger controls (more signers, higher
        thresholds)
      - Classifications reviewed every 6 months and after significant changes (TVL
        shifts, new products, protocol upgrades, security incidents)
    title: Multisig Classification and Risk-Based Controls
  - id: ms-2.1.2
    description: Have you evaluated contract-level security controls that could limit
      the impact of a multisig compromise?

        enforcement, and parameter bounds

  - id: ms-2.1.4
    description: Do you distribute assets across multiple wallets to limit the impact
      of a single compromise?

    description: Do you have a defined process for adding, removing, and periodically
      verifying signers?
    baselines:
