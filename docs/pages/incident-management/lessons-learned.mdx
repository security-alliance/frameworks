Conducting a post-incident review and identifying lessons learned will improve your project's incident response capabilities. By analyzing what went well and what could be improved, you can enhance your readiness for future incidents.

## Best Practices

1. Review the incident together with everybody involved in handling it shortly after the incident is resolved.
2. Record details about the incident, including the timeline, root cause, impact, and response efforts.
3. Assess the effectiveness of the incident response, highlighting areas where the team performed well and areas needing improvement.
4. Create action plans to address identified weaknesses and enhance strengths. Assign responsibilities and deadlines for implementing improvements.
5. Share the lessons learned with the ecosystem to promote awareness and improve overall security practices.
6. Revise incident response policies and procedures based on the lessons learned to ensure continuous improvement.
