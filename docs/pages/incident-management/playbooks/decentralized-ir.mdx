# Decentralized Incident Response Framework (DeIRF)

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

A lightweight, end-to-end scaffold for security teams that work without a single authority.
Use it as a menu, not a mandate.

## 1. Guiding Principles

| Principle | What it means in practice |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| **Zero-trust by default** | Assume every identity, device, and network path is potentially hostile. |
| **Shared responsibility** | Any responder can start an action if quorum rules are met. |
| **Minimum viable process** | Fewer steps, fewer blockers, faster containment. |
| **Open tooling** | Prefer transparent, auditable, community-maintained tools. |
| **Identity plurality** | Accept multiple forms of strong identity proof. |
| **Evidence first** | Collect before you change anything. |
| **Continuous learning** | Retrospective after every incident and drill. |

---

## 2. Roles and Identities

| Role | Key duties | Identity options (at least two) |
|------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| **First Reporter** | Sounds the alarm and starts evidence capture. | GPG key, DID, or multisig wallet signature |
| **Triage Lead** | Confirms severity, forms a swarm, assigns tasks. | FIDO2 passkey, GPG, signed Matrix handle |
| **Comms Lead** | Handles community and regulator updates. | Company issued OIDC, Lens profile |
| **Containment Lead** | Executes on chain actions or host isolation. | Multisig signer, SSH CA cert |
| **Recorder** | Maintains the timeline in an immutable log. | GPG key, signed git commit |

> **Tip**: Publish a public mapping of handles to real names and keep it in a tamper evident repo.

---

## 3. Preparation Checklist

| Item | Why it matters | Suggested tools |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| Asset inventory (code, infra, keys) | You cannot protect what you do not know. | ConfigDB + IaC scans, Sheet/CSV |
| Log pipeline with reliable clock | Forensic accuracy and ordering. | Vector + Loki or OpenSearch, Elasticsearch, RunReveal |
| Secure comms channels | Quick swarm with strong auth. | Matrix + E2EE, Signal groups, Wire |
| Evidence bucket (write-once) | Keeps raw data safe. | S3 object-lock, Storj, or IPFS |
| Automated alert rules | Detect known bad patterns. | On chain monitors, Falco, OpenZeppelin Defender, Slackbot |
| Drill schedule | Muscle memory beats panic. | Calendar invites, gamedays, CTF |

---

## 4. Detection and Triage Flow

1. **Alert fires or user reports an issue.**
2. **First Reporter** opens a ticket in the transparent issue tracker (GitHub security advisory or private GitLab
issue).
3. **Triage Lead** checks severity matrix.
4. If **P1**, spin up a temporary incident channel with a predefined template.
5. Assign Leads and set T-minus deadlines.

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Fast and clear ownership | Relies on people in multiple time zones being awake |
| Public log builds trust | Attackers also watch public data if over-shared |

---

## 5. Containment Options

| Method | When to use | Pros | Cons |
|--------|-------------|------|------|
| **Smart contract pause / circuit breaker** | Critical on-chain bug | Stops further damage instantly | Requires a pre-coded pause function and multisig |
| **Multisig treasury freeze** | Key compromise or theft | No central keyholder | Coordination overhead |
| **Host or pod quarantine** | Off-chain infra breach | Isolates without full shutdown | Needs orchestration rights |
| **DNS or CDN reroute** | Phishing or DDoS | Quick traffic shift | May break some services |

Keep a one-liner command ready for each action and store it in the runbook.

---

## 6. Eradication and Recovery

1. Patch or replace vulnerable code.
2. Peer review with at least two signers.
3. Deploy to staging with replay of attack scenario.
4. Roll forward to production by multisig or automated pipeline.
5. Verify by monitoring metrics and logs for stability.

| Automation hint | Keep it simple |
|-----------------|----------------|
| GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, and Defender Autotasks are popular. | Always include a manual approval gate in case of false positives. |

---

## 7. Post-Incident Actions

| Step | Purpose | Tool Example |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Retrospective within 72 h** | Capture lessons before they fade. | Miro board, Markdown doc in repo |
| **Update runbooks and detection rules** | Prevent repeat events. | Docs-as-code PR |
| **Reward community reporters** | Encourage transparency. | Bug bounty payouts, incentive model |
| **Public disclosure** | Build long-term trust. | Blog post plus on-chain message |

---

## 8. Quick-Start Templates

| Need | Template location |
|------|-------------------|
| Incident channel message | /templates/incident-kickoff.md |
| Retrospective form | /templates/retro-form.md |

---

## 9. Pros and Cons of Decentralized IR

| Aspect | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **No single point of failure** | Resilience if one keyholder is offline. | Slower consensus for urgent actions. |
| **Community trust** | Transparent logs and multisig votes. | Public scrutiny can amplify panic. |
| **Open tools** | Low cost, auditable, extensible. | Less vendor support, more DIY. |
| **Identity plurality** | Flexibility for global teams. | Complex to manage revocation and role drift. |

---

## 10. Keep It Alive

- Run quarterly red team drills.
- Rotate secrets on a fixed cadence.
- Review identity proofs every six months.
- Measure mean time to detect and contain.
- Iterate on this framework during each retrospective.

> **Remember**: Simplicity plus strong fundamentals beat heavy processes every time.
