# North Korea (DPRK) Attack

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

If you’ve been sent this document, then we have very good reason to believe that you have been hacked by North Korea
(DPRK). This document will give you some information about North Korea, why they’ve hacked you, and how they might’ve
done it.

North Korea is an extremely isolated country that has increasingly relied on cybercrime in order to generate revenue for
itself. In **2024**, North Korea stole an estimated **1.34 billion USD** from the cryptocurrency industry alone, and in
**February of 2025**, North Korea stole **1.5 billion USD** from Bybit exchange.

North Korea operates a few different hacking squads, one of which we believe is responsible for compromising your
computer. Each squad has their own preferred methodology, but their end goal is all the same: **to steal your private
keys and your login information**.

If you have been infected by North Korean malware, you should assume your private keys, files, and online accounts have
all been stolen. North Korean hackers may then use your accounts to impersonate you and hack your contacts.

Here are some of the more recent ways we’ve seen North Korea hack people.

## The Fake Video Conference Software

In this method, the hackers will impersonate a person that you know or are likely to trust, like an investor. They will
send you a link to a video call, but it will not be Google Meet, Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or some other common software.
Instead, the domain will be something entirely different.

<br />
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://frameworks-static.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/incident-management/playbooks/example1.png"
  alt="Example 1" width= "500px"/>
  <p><em>A message sent by a North Korean hacker impersonating an investor</em></p>
</div>
<br />

When you visit this link and try to join the call, you will encounter an “error” and be prompted to fix it yourself.

<br />
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://frameworks-static.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/incident-management/playbooks/example2.jpg"
  alt="Example 2"/>
  <p><em>A fake error shown by the North Korean website</em></p>
</div>
<br />

The instructions that you are provided will install malware on your computer.

## The Fake PDF

In this method, you are sent a link to download a report, slide deck, or other plausible document.

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://frameworks-static.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/incident-management/playbooks/example3.png"
  alt="Example 3" width= "500px"/>
  <p><em>An example of a North Korean hacker attempting to share a link to malware</em></p>
</div>
<br />
<div align="center">
  <img src="https://frameworks-static.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images/incident-management/playbooks/example4.png"
  alt="Example 4" width= "500px"/>
  <p><em>An older example of a North Korean phishing email</em></p>
</div>

If you download and run this file, you will have executed the malware. The first thing the malware does is open the PDF
file you were expecting, so that you do not suspect you were infected.
