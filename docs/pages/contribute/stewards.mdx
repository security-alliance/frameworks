# Stewardship

## What is a Framework Steward?

A framework steward is the champion and caretaker for an individual security framework (most frameworks
here -> [https://frameworks.securityalliance.org](https://frameworks.securityalliance.org) are currently
available for adoption). This role goes beyond casual contribution.
It's about taking ownership and helping guide the framework's development through community engagement.

## The Steward's Role

A framework steward is a project management role, responsible for:

- **Rallying collaborators**: Recruit contributors who share your passion for specific security challenges
- **Managing contributions**: Help triage [GitHub issues](https://github.com/security-alliance/frameworks/issues) and
    coordinate improvements
- **Advocating for adoption**: Work with SEAL to promote your framework within your networks and the broader Web3
    community
- **Creating content**: Work with SEAL to write blog posts, host workshops, or share best practices related to your
    framework
- **Representing the community**: Be a voice for practitioners who use and rely on these standards

The core SEAL team will support you throughout this journey, helping you focus on specific challenges rather than
drowning in administrative tasks.

## Why Become a Steward?

### Recognition and Growth

- **Earn achievement badges**: Receive public recognition with roles like Security Framework Ambassador or DAO
    Safeguards Steward
- **Build your reputation**: Establish yourself as a thought leader in Web3 security
- **Develop new skills**: Gain experience in open-source governance, technical writing, and community building

### Tangible Benefits

- **Access exclusive events**: Receive tickets to security conferences and invite-only Security Alliance gatherings
- **Showcase your expertise**: Get featured through SEAL's official channels, including our
    [blog](https://www.securityalliance.org/news) and [social media](https://twitter.com/_SEAL_Org)
- **Connect with peers**: Build relationships with other security professionals who share your interests

### Lasting Impact

- **Shape industry standards**: Help develop frameworks that could become foundational to Web3 security
- **Prevent security incidents**: Your work will directly contribute to a safer ecosystem
- **Leave a legacy**: Carve your name into the DNA of Web3 security practices for years to come

## Stewardship in Action: What It Looks Like

### Time Commitment

Being a steward doesn't mean giving up your day job. We're looking for contributors who can dedicate approximately 3
hours per week to their framework. This might include:

- Reviewing [pull requests](https://github.com/security-alliance/frameworks/pulls) and GitHub issues
- Participating in sporadic steward meetings
- Creating occasional content or presentations
- Engaging with the community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/securityalliance)

### Support Structure

You won't be working alone. You will have:

- Access to a dedicated channel on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/securityalliance)
- Coordination calls with the SEAL team as needed
- Documentation templates and contribution guidelines
- Access to technical advisors when needed

## How to Apply

Ready to become a framework steward? Here's how to get started:

1. Review the proposed frameworks at [frameworks.securityalliance.org](https://frameworks.securityalliance.org) and
    identify which one aligns with your expertise and interests.
2. Join our [steward candidates Telegram channel](https://t.me/+Yd9OpSt1UvcyMjU5) and introduce yourself to let us know
    which Framework you want to adopt.

We're looking for diverse perspectives and experiences, and you don't need to have decades of experience. Passion,
dedication, and a willingness to learn are just as important.

## Join Us in Building a Safer Web3

The "Adopt a Framework" campaign isn't just about improving documentation. You'll be part of a movement where security
becomes a shared responsibility across the Web3 ecosystem.

ensuring that innovation can continue without compromising safety.

We're just getting started, and we need your expertise.
