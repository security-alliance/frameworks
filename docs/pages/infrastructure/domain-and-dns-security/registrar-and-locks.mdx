# Registrar Security & Registry Locks

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Enterprise vs Consumer Registrars

- MarkMonitor (enterprise)
- AWS Route53 Registrar (check TLD support)
- Cloudflare Registrar (with Cloudflare stack)

Consumer registrars to avoid for critical domains (risk examples): ICANN Compliance Notices; GoDaddy social engineering incidents; low-tech high-impact breaches.

See also: ICANN Compliance Notices and notable incidents for registrar risk context.

## Registry Lock (EPP) vs DNS Panel

EPP statuses apply to registry objects (transfers, deletes, some updates), not DNS zone edits at your provider panel.

Common statuses:
- `clientTransferProhibited`, `clientUpdateProhibited`, `clientDeleteProhibited`
- `serverTransferProhibited`, `serverUpdateProhibited`, `serverDeleteProhibited`

Registry locks do not block record edits in provider DNS; they do block transfers/deletes and critical registry updates. Server-level locks often require manual verification with the registry.

EPP statuses to monitor:
- `clientTransferProhibited`, `clientUpdateProhibited`, `clientDeleteProhibited`
- `serverTransferProhibited`, `serverUpdateProhibited`, `serverDeleteProhibited`

## MFA Guidance

- Prefer FIDO2/WebAuthn hardware keys; avoid SMS; TOTP as fallback.

## WHOIS vs RDAP

Prefer RDAP for structured data and links to registrar/registry endpoints. Use RDAP CLIs or web tools for audits.

## Dedicated Security Contact & Access Controls

- Use a separate security contact domain/email outside your main domain.
- Maintain role-based access, approval workflows, and quarterly access audits.

## Expiration Protection

- Enable auto-renew, set multi-stage reminders (90/60/30/7 days), and register for max term.
- Monitor upcoming expirations, ensure payment methods are current, and designate backups.
