# Monitoring, Alerts, and GitOps for DNS

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## What to Watch

- NS changes; DNSSEC broken; CAA removed/overridden; sudden TTL drops (note: low TTL is common with CDNs; Cloudflare "Auto" often 300s)
- When NS unchanged: A/AAAA, MX, TXT (SPF/DMARC) modifications

Note: Child zones override parent CAA. Parameters like `accounturi` and `validationmethods` can provide finer control.

## Monitoring Tools

- MXToolbox, HetrixTools, SecurityTrails (change tracking/historical)
- DNSViz (DNSSEC chain validation and debugging)
- Passive DNS: Mnemonic, SecurityTrails, RiskIQ (historical resolution)

## GitOps & Zone Control

- OctoDNS and DNSControl enable auditable, reviewed DNS changes via code and CI.

## Certificate Transparency Monitoring

- crt.sh and Cert Spotter for new/unauthorized certs (watch wildcards if unused).

## Alerts & Incident Response (Quick Reference)

Critical alerts: Registrar changed, NS changed, DNSSEC broken, CAA removed, TTL under 60s. High priority (NS unchanged): A/MX/TXT changes, DMARC policy weakened, unexpected certificate issued.

Incident response: Verify compromise; access registrar; contact security team; document; contain (registry lock, NS updates); communicate; recover (audit records, reset credentials); investigate; improve.
