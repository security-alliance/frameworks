# DNS Basics & Common Attacks

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## How DNS Resolution Works

When users type your domain, their request may traverse multiple trust points (flows vary by resolver caching, stub resolver config, and provider):
1. Local device cache
2. ISP/recursive DNS resolver
3. Root nameservers
4. TLD registry servers
5. Your authoritative nameservers

## Common Attack Vectors

- Social Engineering at Registrars: Attackers convince/bribe support staff they're legitimate owners using publicly available information
- Expired Domain Sniping: Domains that expire enter a grace period before becoming publicly available to anyone
- DNS Hijacking: Unauthorized changes to DNS records redirecting traffic to malicious servers
- Email Interception (MX tampering): Password reset attacks and communication interception
- DNS Tunneling: Encoding data within DNS queries for covert communication channels, often used for data exfiltration
- DNS Cache Poisoning: Injecting forged responses into a resolverâ€™s cache to redirect subsequent queries
