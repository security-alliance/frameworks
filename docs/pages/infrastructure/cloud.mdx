# Cloud Infrastructure

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Securing your cloud infrastructure could be considered as important as securing your decentralized application, as a lot
of users will be interacting with your dapp through the cloud provider. Some best practices to consider are:

1. Implement strict access controls and identity management to ensure that only authorized individuals can interact with
cloud resources. Use role-based access control (RBAC) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
2. Encrypt data both in transit and at rest. Use managed encryption keys or bring your own keys (BYOK) for enhanced
security.
3. Configure virtual private clouds (VPCs), implement firewalls, and monitor network traffic to protect against
unauthorized access and threats.
4. Set up comprehensive logging, monitoring, and threat detection systems to identify and respond to security incidents
in real-time. Use services like AWS CloudTrail, Azure Monitor, and Google Cloud Logging.
5. Implement high availability, data backup, and disaster recovery plans to protect against service disruptions. Use
automated fail-over and replication strategies.
6. Ensure compliance with regulatory requirements (e.g., GDPR, MiCA).

## Cloud Provider Hardening Guides

All cloud providers have hardening guides that provide step-by-step instructions and best practices for securing cloud
infrastructure:

- **AWS**: [Security, Identity, and Compliance](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/security-identity-compliance/)
- **Azure**:
[Best Practices and Patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/fundamentals/best-practices-and-patterns)
- **GCP**: [Security Best Practices](https://cloud.google.com/security/best-practices)

## Open Source Tools

To aid with vulnerability detection and compliance, you could consider using the following open-source tools:

- **CloudSploit**: [CloudSploit](https://github.com/aquasecurity/cloudsploit)
- **Prowler**: [Prowler](https://github.com/prowler-cloud/prowler)
- **S3Scanner (AWS)**: [S3Scanner](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner)
- **Zeus (AWS)**: [Zeus](https://github.com/DenizParlak/Zeus)
