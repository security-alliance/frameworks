DNS (Domain Name System) is the backbone of the internet, translating domain names into IP addresses. In Web3, domain security is particularly critical as compromised domains can lead to irreversible financial losses through wallet drainers and phishing attacks. Unlike traditional web applications where stolen funds can sometimes be recovered, blockchain transactions are permanent, making domain security a matter of financial survival for Web3 projects.

## Understanding the Attack Surface

### How DNS Resolution Works
When users type your domain, their request traverses multiple trust points:
1. Local device cache
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
2. ISP DNS resolver

3. Root nameservers
4. TLD registry servers
5. Your authoritative nameservers

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
Each step represents a potential attack vector where responses can be intercepted, modified, or poisoned. This multi-step process creates numerous opportunities for attackers to redirect users to malicious sites while their browser still shows the correct domain name.

### Common Attack Vectors
- **Social Engineering at Registrars**: Attackers convince support staff they're legitimate owners using publicly available information
- **Expired Domain Sniping**: Domains that expire enter a grace period before becoming publicly available to anyone
- **DNS Hijacking**: Unauthorized changes to DNS records redirecting traffic to malicious servers
- **Email Interception**: Compromised MX records allowing password reset attacks and communication interception
- **DNS Tunneling**: Encoding data within DNS queries for covert communication channels, often used for data exfiltration

## DNS-Level Security

### 1. DNSSEC Implementation
<<<<<<< HEAD
DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) provides cryptographic authentication of DNS responses, preventing attackers from redirecting your users to malicious sites by tampering with DNS queries. Think of it as a digital signature that proves the DNS response came from the legitimate source.

**How it protects you**: Without DNSSEC, attackers can intercept DNS queries and return fake IP addresses, redirecting users to malicious sites that look identical to yours. DNSSEC prevents this by cryptographically signing all DNS responses.

**Setup process**:
1. **Enable DNSSEC signing** at your DNS provider (most providers have this as a simple toggle)
2. **Publish DS records** to your registrar (your DNS provider will give you these records)
3. **Monitor DNSSEC validation** status regularly using online tools
4. **Test configuration** using tools like DNSViz or Verisign DNSSEC Debugger

### 2. CAA Records
Certificate Authority Authorization (CAA) records specify which Certificate Authorities (CAs) are allowed to issue SSL certificates for your domain. This prevents unauthorized certificate issuance, which attackers could use to create fake SSL certificates for your domain.

**How it protects you**: Without CAA records, any Certificate Authority can issue SSL certificates for your domain. Attackers could potentially obtain fake certificates and use them in sophisticated phishing attacks that appear to have valid SSL encryption.

**Setup process**: Add CAA records to your DNS zone. Most DNS providers allow you to add these through their web interface:

### 3. Email Security Configuration
Email security records protect against email spoofing and phishing attacks. When your domain is compromised, attackers often change email settings to intercept password reset emails and other sensitive communications.

#### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
SPF records specify which mail servers are authorized to send emails on behalf of your domain. This prevents attackers from spoofing your domain in phishing emails.

**How it protects you**: Without SPF, anyone can send emails claiming to be from your domain. Attackers use this for sophisticated phishing campaigns that appear to come from your legitimate email address.

**Setup**: Add an SPF record to your DNS zone:

#### SPF (Sender Policy Framework)
>>>>>>> 314331b (feat: comprehensive DNS and domain registration security guide)
```dns
example.com. TXT "v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all"
```

#### DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication)
<<<<<<< HEAD
DMARC builds on SPF and DKIM to provide policy enforcement for email authentication. It tells receiving mail servers what to do with emails that fail authentication checks.

**How it protects you**: DMARC prevents email spoofing by instructing receiving servers to reject or quarantine emails that fail authentication, protecting your users from phishing attacks.

**Setup**: Add a DMARC record to your DNS zone:
=======
>>>>>>> 314331b (feat: comprehensive DNS and domain registration security guide)
```dns
_dmarc.example.com. TXT "v=DMARC1; p=reject; rua=mailto:dmarc@example.com; ruf=mailto:forensics@example.com"
```

#### DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)
<<<<<<< HEAD
DKIM adds a digital signature to your emails, allowing receiving servers to verify that emails actually came from your domain and haven't been tampered with.

**How it protects you**: DKIM signatures prove email authenticity and integrity, making it much harder for attackers to successfully spoof your domain in phishing campaigns.

**Setup**: Configure with your email provider and publish public keys in DNS (your email provider will provide the specific records).

#### MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)
MTA-STS enforces encrypted connections between mail servers, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks on email transmission.

**How it protects you**: Without MTA-STS, emails can be intercepted in transit. This is especially critical for password reset emails and other sensitive communications.

**Setup**: Add an MTA-STS record to your DNS zone:
=======
Configure with your email provider and publish public keys in DNS.

#### MTA-STS (Mail Transfer Agent Strict Transport Security)
>>>>>>> 314331b (feat: comprehensive DNS and domain registration security guide)
```dns
_mta-sts.example.com. TXT "v=STSv1; id=20240101000000"
```

## Registrar Security

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
### 1. Choosing a Secure Registrar
Your domain registrar is the company that manages your domain registration with the central registry. This is often the weakest link in domain security, as many registrars have poor security practices and are vulnerable to social engineering attacks.

#### Enterprise-Grade Registrars (Recommended)
These registrars are designed for high-value domains and have security measures that consumer registrars lack:

- **MarkMonitor**: Used by Fortune 500 companies, requires legal documentation for changes, dedicated security team
- **CSC (Corporation Service Company)**: Registry-level domain locks, dedicated account management, mandatory multi-factor authentication
- **AWS Route53**: IAM policy integration, CloudTrail logging, uses Amazon Registrar for major TLDs (but check TLD support)
- **Cloudflare Registrar**: No markup pricing, automatic DNSSEC, built-in DDoS protection, requires Cloudflare services

#### Consumer Registrars to Avoid for Critical Domains
These registrars are designed for personal use and lack the security measures needed for Web3 projects:

- **GoDaddy**: History of social engineering vulnerabilities, call center support vulnerable to manipulation
- **Consumer-focused services** (Google Domains/Squarespace): Designed for personal use, not enterprise security
- **Resellers**: Add another layer of complexity and potential attack surface

### 2. Registrar-Level Protections

#### Registry Lock (EPP Lock)
Registry lock prevents unauthorized transfers at the registry level, not just the registrar. This is the strongest protection available for domain security.

**How it protects you**: Standard transfer locks only prevent transfers between registrars, but registry locks require manual verification with the registry operator (like Verisign for .com domains) for any changes, making social engineering attacks much more difficult.

**Setup**: Contact enterprise registrars for registry-operator level locks. This typically requires additional fees and documentation but provides the highest level of security.

#### Multi-Factor Authentication
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security beyond just passwords, which are easily compromised through phishing or data breaches.

**Authentication options** (in order of security):
- **Hardware Security Keys** (YubiKey/FIDO2): Most secure option, immune to phishing
- **TOTP Applications** (Google Authenticator, Authy): Minimum acceptable standard
- **Avoid SMS 2FA**: Vulnerable to SIM swapping attacks

#### Dedicated Security Contact Email
Use a dedicated email address for domain security that's completely separate from your main domain and personal accounts.

**Why this matters**: If your main domain is compromised, you need a way to receive security notifications and regain control. Using the same domain creates a circular dependency.

❌ admin@yourdomain.com (circular dependency)
❌ personal@gmail.com (too many attack vectors)
✅ domain-security-only@protonmail.com (isolated, dedicated purpose)
```

#### Access Control Best Practices
Limit and monitor who has access to your domain registrar account, as each person with access represents a potential attack vector.

>>>>>>> 1286c13 (style: add consistent numbering to DNS security section headings)
- Document all personnel with registrar access
- Use role-based access where available
- Implement approval workflows for critical changes
- Regular access audits (quarterly minimum)

## Monitoring and Detection

<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
<<<<<<< HEAD
### 1. DNS Record Monitoring
DNS record monitoring involves continuously checking your domain's DNS records for unauthorized changes. Attackers often modify DNS records to redirect traffic to malicious servers while keeping your site partially functional.

**What to watch for**:
- **Nameserver (NS) record changes**: Attackers change your nameservers to point to their own DNS servers
- **TTL values dropping below 300 seconds**: Very low TTLs can indicate preparation for rapid DNS changes
- **New A/AAAA records or changes to existing ones**: IP address changes could redirect users to malicious sites
- **MX record modifications**: Email server changes could intercept password reset emails
- **CAA record removal**: Allows any Certificate Authority to issue certificates for your domain
- **DNSSEC disabled unexpectedly**: Removes cryptographic protection from DNS responses

### 2. Certificate Transparency Monitoring
Certificate Transparency (CT) logs are public records of all SSL certificates issued by Certificate Authorities. Monitoring these logs helps detect unauthorized certificate issuance.

**Why it matters**: Attackers sometimes obtain fake SSL certificates for legitimate domains to make phishing sites appear more credible. CT monitoring helps you detect these certificates before they're used in attacks.

**Setup**:
- Monitor CT logs for unauthorized certificate issuance
- Set up alerts for new certificates via services like crt.sh monitoring
- Watch for wildcard certificates if you don't use them (could indicate broader compromise)

### 3. Passive DNS Monitoring
Passive DNS monitoring tracks historical DNS resolution data across the internet, helping you detect brief changes that might be missed by periodic checks.

**What it detects**:
- **Brief record changes**: Attackers often make quick changes to avoid detection
- **Geographic anomalies**: DNS records resolving to unexpected countries or regions
- **Suspicious hosting provider changes**: Sudden switches to hosting providers known for malicious activity

## Web3-Specific Considerations

### Why Domain Security is Critical in Web3
<<<<<<< HEAD
Domain security is exponentially more critical in Web3 compared to traditional web applications due to the unique characteristics of blockchain technology:

- **Irreversible transactions**: Unlike traditional banking where stolen funds can sometimes be recovered, blockchain transactions are permanent. Once funds are stolen through a domain hijack, they're gone forever.
- **Direct wallet interactions**: Users connect their wallets directly to your domain, giving attackers immediate access to user funds without needing to compromise individual accounts.
- **Smart contract immutability**: While smart contracts are secure, they can't help if users never reach them because they're redirected to malicious sites.
- **Reputation damage**: One domain hijack incident can permanently destroy protocol trust, as users lose confidence in the project's security practices.

### Additional Web3 Protections
Beyond traditional domain security measures, Web3 projects should implement additional protections:

- **ENS domains as backup communication**: Use Ethereum Name Service domains as alternative communication channels that are harder to compromise
- **Multiple warning channels**: Implement redundant communication systems (Twitter, Discord, Telegram) to warn users during incidents
- **Decentralized hosting for security notices**: Use IPFS or other decentralized hosting for critical security notices that can't be taken down
- **On-chain DNS record verification**: Maintain cryptographically signed DNS record hashes on-chain for tamper-proof verification
=======
- **Irreversible transactions**: Stolen funds cannot be reversed
