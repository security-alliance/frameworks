# Zero-Trust Principles

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

The Zero-Trust security model assumes that threats can exist both inside and outside the network. It requires strict
verification for every user and device attempting to access resources, regardless of their location.

## Key Principles

1. Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points, including user identity, location, device
health, and service or workload.
2. Limit user access with just-in-time and just-enough-access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data
protection.
3. Segment networks and use encryption to limit the potential impact of a breach.

## Implementation Strategies

1. Implement strong IAM practices, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) and conditional access policies.
2. Use micro-segmentation to create secure zones in data centers and cloud environments.
3. Ensure all endpoints (e.g., devices, servers) comply with security policies before granting access.
4. Implement continuous monitoring and analytics to detect and respond to anomalies in real-time.
5. Use automation to enforce security policies consistently across the network.
