Identifying and mitigating threats is a crucial part of the threat modeling process. By understanding potential threats
and developing strategies to address them, projects can help protect their systems and data from security incidents.

## Identifying Threats

1. **Threat Enumeration**
   - Use frameworks like STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation
   of Privilege) to systematically identify potential threats.
   - Consider various threat actors, including insiders, external attackers, and automated threats.

2. **Attack Surface Analysis**
   - Analyze the attack surface to identify all potential entry points for attackers.
   - Include smart contracts, wallets, external interfaces, APIs, third-party integrations, and user inputs in the
   analysis.

3. **Adversary Modeling**
   - Develop profiles of potential adversaries, including their capabilities, goals, and motivations.
   - Consider different threat actors, such as black hats and nation-state actors.

4. **Historical Data**
   - Review past security incidents and vulnerabilities to identify common attack patterns and weaknesses.
   - Use vulnerability databases and threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about emerging threats.

## Mitigating Threats

1. **Security Controls**
   - Implement security controls to mitigate identified threats. These can include technical controls, administrative
   controls (e.g., policies, procedures), and physical controls.

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - Apply the principle of defense in depth by implementing multiple layers of security controls.
   - Ensure that if one control fails, additional controls are in place to provide protection.

3. **Least Privilege**
   - Follow the principle of least privilege by granting users and systems the minimum level of access necessary to
   perform their functions.
   - Regularly review and adjust access permissions to reduce the risk of privilege escalation.

4. **Security by Design**
   - Incorporate security into the design and development processes from the outset.
   - Use secure coding practices, perform regular code reviews, and conduct security testing throughout the development
   lifecycle.

5. **Monitoring and Detection**
   - Implement continuous monitoring to detect and respond to security incidents in real time.

6. **Incident Response**
   - Develop and maintain an [incident response plan](/incident-management/overview) to quickly and effectively address
   security incidents.
   - Train team members on incident response procedures and conduct regular drills to ensure readiness.
