<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

This framework serves as an entry point to understanding the organizational and personal risks related to "Insider
Threats," most commonly (though not exclusively) associated with "DPRK IT Workers" - the North Korean
hacker-freelancers. This framework is targeted at projects affected by insider threat actors as well as projects wanting
to harden their posture against these actors.

Throughout this module, we will discuss:

- Who insider threat actors are and what they do
- How to recognize insider threat actors
- How to interact with a potential threat actor
- How to mitigate the risks and impact of insider threat actors
- How to harden your defenses against insider threat actors
- Potential consequences of insider threats for you and your organization

### Overview of risks to your organization

1. **Defrauding the company:** The company is paying someone whose identity they do not know.
2. **Subpar operational security:** DPRK IT workers share credentials among themselves in open channels, have a poor
  command of Git, and unintentionally or intentionally leak the access they are granted to third parties.
3. **Extortion:** They may try to extort more money after a job is finished.
4. **Future hacking activities:** They may use the knowledge gained for future hacking activities.
5. **Sanctions violations:** The DPRK is a sanctioned entity. No company can legally transfer funds to DPRK-related
  operations.
6. **Contribution to the North Korean Military:** DPRK IT worker salaries directly contribute to the Military Ministry
  of North Korea. The workers do not keep the salaries for themselves.
7. **Supply-chain compromise:** DPRK IT Workers may intentionally introduce vulnerabilities that impact down-stream
  projects that depend on your software / services (e.g. SafeWallet UI in the ByBit hack).
8. **Reputational damage:** To your brand and loss of trust of your users and customers.
9. **Asset freeze / loss of access to financial services:** your assets may be frozen or seized, and financial
  institutions (e.g. banks, exchanges) may terminate your access if you are suspected of funding sanctioned entities.
10. **Criminal investigations:** Law enforcement may investigate your involvement and impose fines or press criminal
  charges against your organization.
