# Signal Configuration Guide

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.

## Individual Account Settings

> **Important**: Use Signal! Chats on Signal are secured with the gold standard of end-to-end encryption and privacy features. Signal is the best place to have truly anonymous chats.
> 
> If you don't use Signal, you should at least create an account with your phone number and lock it so that you cannot be impersonated to others via SIM swap attacks.

> **Note**: You must be on the phone app to see all of these settings.
