# Account Security Configuration Guides

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> These configuration checklists are adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/AuditWare-io/W3OSC) standards.

These guides provide actionable, platform-specific configuration checklists to help secure your accounts and services. Each checklist contains the specific settings you should review and configure to maximize security.

## How to Use These Guides

1. **Select your context**: Choose whether you're configuring settings for your personal/individual accounts or for an organization
2. **Find your platform**: Navigate to the specific service you want to secure
3. **Work through the checklist**: Each checkbox represents a setting to review and configure
4. **Revisit periodically**: Account settings should be reviewed regularly as platforms add new security features
