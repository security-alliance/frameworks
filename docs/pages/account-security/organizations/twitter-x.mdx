## Notes

### [1] Email Security

It is recommended to ensure the email you use does not match your public name, is publicly known, or is easily guessable.

You can easily work around this by supplementing your email address with a "+" suffix - e.g. myemailusername+randomcharacters@gmail.com (works with Gmail and iCloud emails).
