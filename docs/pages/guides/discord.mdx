# Discord Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Discord:** To secure your Discord server, focus on implementing robust access controls and
> enforcing two-factor authentication for all administrators. Regularly audit roles and permissions, and maintain
> vigilant moderation. Educate your community about security best practices to prevent unauthorized access and protect
> against potential threats.

Discord offers a variety of security features that are essential to use. Despite these, users should stay alert to
threats like phishing, which can target server moderators. Such threats may appear as QR code scams, fake login screens,
or misleading direct messages pretending to be from Discord support.

To enhance the security of your Discord server, take into account these suggestions. They cover important aspects like
server settings, roles and permissions, moderation, bots, channels, invites, member screening, logging, and other
security measures.

---

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal Discord account. All team members, moderators, and admins should configure these
on their own accounts.

### Account Security Checklist

- [ ] User Settings > My Account: Ensure **2FA** is enabled (authenticator app and/or security key), Remove a phone
  number if you have one added to your account, and after 2FA is setup select **View Backup Codes**, and note down
  your backup codes offline
- [ ] User Settings > My Account: Ensure **SMS Backup Authentication** is **disabled**
- [ ] User Settings > Content & Social > Social Permissions: Allow DMs from other server members > **Disabled**
- [ ] User Settings > Content & Social > Direct Message Spam: Select **Filter all** to filter all DMs for spam
  (encourages moderators and community members to adopt the same setting to minimize phishing DMs)
- [ ] User Settings > Authorized Apps: Review and **Deauthorize** any unnecessary apps
- [ ] User Setting > Devices: Review and remove unnecessary devices, or **Log Out All Known Devices**
- [ ] User Settings > Connections: Review and remove any unnecessary connections

---

## For Team Members

These guidelines apply to moderators and team members who help manage the server but don't have full administrative access.

Team members should:

- Understand the permissions their role grants using **Server Settings > Roles > View Server as Role** — this allows
  you to see what members with a certain role can see and access
- Be aware of the server's AutoMod rules for: Spam, Harmful Links, Mention Spam, Inappropriate Words, and any custom
  keyword filters and exempted roles

---

## For Admins

These settings and practices apply to server administrators with elevated privileges.

### Server Settings Checklist

#### Safety Setup

- Safety Setup > Moderation:
  - [ ] Require 2FA for moderation > **Enabled**
  - This ensures all moderators have an extra layer of security
- Safety Setup > Verification Level:
  - [ ] Choose from: None, Low, Medium, High, Highest
  - [ ] Set to at least **Medium** (registered on Discord for 5+ minutes) — Recommended: "Moderate" for public servers
  - Higher levels protect against spammers and raids
- Safety Setup > Raid Protection and CAPTCHA:
  - [ ] Activate all relevant settings to require CAPTCHA for new user actions
  - [ ] Activity Alerts > **Enabled**
  - [ ] CAPTCHA suspicious accounts before they are able to join > **Enabled**
  - [ ] CAPTCHA all accounts before they are able to join during a suspected raid > **Enabled**
  - This protection uses machine learning to detect and block bot-driven join-raids. When activated, it sends alerts
    to a specified channel and requires CAPTCHA verification for new users for one hour after detection.
- Safety Setup > DM and Spam Protection:
  - [ ] Hide DMs from suspicious users > **Enabled**
  - [ ] Filter DMs from unknown users > **Enabled**
  - [ ] Warn members before they visit outbound links > **Enabled**
  - [ ] Hide all messages from and delete suspected spammers > **Enabled**

#### AutoMod

- Server Settings > Safety Setup > AutoMod:
  - [ ] Set up rules for: **Spam**, **Harmful Links**, **Mention Spam**, **Inappropriate Words**
  - [ ] Configure custom keyword filters and exempted roles
  - [ ] Customize the response to spam (block message, send alert, timeout member)
  - [ ] Add to the existing automod rule to block keywords in a user's name: Support, Bot, Admin, Tech, Helpdesk, etc.
  - [ ] Create a private channel that mods, team, and admins have visibility to and set each AutoMod rule to send
    logs to that channel for review

#### Server Overview

- Server Settings > Engagement > Default Notification Settings: Select **Only @mentions**
  - Reduces potential spam notifications for members, making them more vigilant about suspicious or phishing content

#### Roles

- Server Settings > Roles:
  - [ ] Review admin role members — high-privilege roles with **Administrator** permission should have **2-3 members
    max**
  - [ ] Review bot role permissions and confirm members list contains only the bot user
  - [ ] Review mod role permissions and members list
  - [ ] Review user role permissions — watch for: **Manage Channels**, **Manage Roles**, **Manage Webhooks**, **Manage
    Server**, **Administrator**
  - [ ] Remove any lingering or overly broad permissions, and any roles with excess or unintended members
  - [ ] Check channel-level permission overrides on private channels

> **Note on Role Permissions:** For each role, carefully review the 32 available permissions. Key permissions to
> restrict: Administrator, Manage Webhooks, Manage Server, Manage Roles, & Manage Channels. Never give Admin or Kick
> permissions to anyone you don't fully trust.
>
> **Administrator** should ideally be reserved for a single admin role with minimal members. It is recommended to have
> no more than 2-3 admins with this privilege in order to reduce risk due to account compromise and insider threats,
> but to retain some redundancy.
>
> Minimal bots actually need **Administrator** permissions. Review what permissions a bot actually needs and do not
> default to Admin permissions just because developers request it as the easy option. If a bot does require
> Administrator, mitigate this risk by monitoring the Discord audit logs frequently or create alerts on a private
> channel to notify when admin permissions are exercised within the server.
>
> Permissions can also be set at the channel level. It is important to check your private channels for any permission
> overrides that may have been set!

#### Integrations

- Server Settings > Integrations:
  - [ ] Review each bot's permissions and remove unnecessary permissions
  - [ ] Remove any unnecessary integrations & reevaluate necessity of integrations with excessive permissions
- Server Settings > Integrations > Manage Bot/App > **Roles & Members** / **Channels**:
  - [ ] Remove permissions for bots that ask for Admin or other permissions that aren't needed — use least privilege
    with permissions at the role level and channel level
  - [ ] Uninstall any bots that aren't actively used or needed
  - [ ] Confirm all bots and apps are
    [**Verified**](https://support-dev.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/23926564536471-How-Do-I-Get-My-App-Verified)
  - [ ] Restrict command permissions of integrations where possible (Manage > Roles & Members / Channels / Command
    Overrides)
- Server Settings > Integrations > Webhooks:
  - [ ] Review and remove any unnecessary webhooks
  - [ ] Reevaluate necessity of webhooks with excessive permissions

> **Note on Integration Security:** Integrations and webhooks add 3rd party risk and permission misconfiguration risk.
> Ensure that permissions are correct, and either remove external integrations or understand the risk they present.

#### Invites

- Server Settings > Invites:
  - [ ] Review and delete unnecessary or old invites regularly

#### Privacy Settings

- Server Settings > Privacy Settings:
  - [ ] Disable **Direct Messages** — this prevents users from DMing other members in this server

#### Community Features

- Server Settings > Community:
  - [ ] Enable the Community Feature
  - Unlocks tools like membership screening, server insights, welcome screen, and discovery settings. Helps maintain
    a structured, secure environment by surfacing official rules and critical info to newcomers.
- Server Settings > Server Insights:
  - [ ] Enable Server Insights for detailed analytics
  - Use this data to inform moderation strategies and server improvements

> **Note on Safety Features:**
>
> - Activity alerts notify on anomalous DM activity, which could indicate your community is being targeted by scammers
>   or social engineering attackers.
> - Raid Protection and CAPTCHA can also be satisfied by a bot, if preferred over Discord's built-in functionality.
> - Hiding/filtering DMs between server members is recommended to prevent scams, spam, and social engineering of your
>   users.
> - In the event of a security incident, Discord provides
>   [**Security Actions**](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/17439993574167-Activity-Alerts-Security-Actions#h_01HAD80CK67WF59GDGR7XGVAN8)
>   for pausing invites and DMs to allow you to protect your community while responding to ongoing threats.

### Role Hierarchy Setup

Roles should be structured with higher-privilege roles at the top. Go to Server Settings > Roles, create roles like
Cold Admin, Team, Moderator, & Verified, and drag to reorder (higher roles override lower roles):

1. Cold Admin (highest)
2. Team
3. Moderator
4. Verified (lowest)

**Recommended permissions by role:**

| Role | Recommended Permissions |
| ---- | ----------------------- |
| **Moderators** | View Channels, View Audit Log, View Server Insights, Kick Members, Ban Members, Timeout Members, Send Messages and Create Posts, Embed Links, Attach Files, Add Reactions, Add External Emoji, Use External Stickers, Manage Messages, Bypass Slowmode, Read Message History, Request to Speak |
| **Members** | View Channels, Send Messages and Create Posts, Embed Links, Add Reactions, Read Message History, Request to Speak |

Use **Server Settings > Roles > [Role] > View Server as Role** to see what members with a certain role can see and access.

---

### Channel Management

#### Organization

- Use categories to group related channels
- Suggested categories: Information, General, Voice Channels, Topic-Specific

#### Per-Channel Settings

(Right-click channel > Edit Channel > Permissions):

- [ ] Set custom permissions for roles or members in specific channels

#### Channel Settings > Overview

- [ ] Slow Mode: Set appropriate cooldown (e.g., 5-30 seconds) for busy channels
- [ ] Age-Restricted Channel: Enable for channels with mature content

---

### Member Screening Setup

Beyond enabling in Safety Setup:

- Implement a verification bot like Wick that does in-channel captcha for users to join the server
- Require users to complete an in-channel captcha before accessing the server
- Advance Settings: Have verification bot filter based on account age, PFP set, and timeout for incomplete captcha

---

### Invite Best Practices

When creating invites:

- Set "Expire After" (recommended: 24 hours)
- Set "Max Number of Uses" (recommended: 50-100)

---

### Logging Setup

- Ensure admin/mod roles have "View Audit Log" permission
- Create a private logging channel visible only to admins/mods
- Use a logging bot like Logger or Dyno to send detailed logs
- Configure audit log output to a private channel for easier monitoring

---

### Security Bots

Various third-party Discord bots offer valuable security and protection features, facilitating automated moderation
for your server. In the sections below, we'll explore different categories of security bots and highlight popular
options for each category.

#### Anti-Impersonation Bots

Set up custom rules to prevent other users from joining using the same username and PFP (profile picture) to
impersonate you or other important members of the server. A popular bot in this category is
[Hashbot](https://hashbot.com).

#### Anti-Raid Bots

To prevent spam bots from joining your server all at once, an attack known as raiding, you can also set up bots with
particular rules. Beemo is a good example of a bot in this category.

#### Anti-Nuke Bots

This is a monitoring system to observe and note any changes (spontaneous or planned) that take place in your discord
server. Some key observation markers are channel and role creation/deletions, banning or kicking members, and webhook
creation/deletion.

#### Moderation & Link Whitelisting Bots

Only allows approved links to be used in the discord server. A popular bot in this category is Goodknight Bot.

#### General Moderation Bots

Consider bots like Dyno for advanced moderation and logging, or Carl-bot for reaction roles and custom commands. Set
up security Bots as described above.

_The bots above are not all-inclusive but rather a recommended list of bots to help protect your Discord server in
these categories._

---

### Establish Clear Server Rules

- Create a #rules channel
- Use Discord's built-in rules screening feature
- Include sections on: Behavior, Content, Moderation Actions, Appeals Process

---

### Regular Reviews

| Frequency | Action |
| --------- | ------ |
| **Monthly** | Review all role permissions; use a spreadsheet to track changes and justifications |
| **Quarterly** | Assess if server rules need updating; announce any changes in a dedicated announcements channel |
| **Bi-annually** | Delete or archive inactive channels; remove roles that are no longer needed |

Also regularly:

- Ensure bots are from reputable sources and receive frequent updates
- Review bot permissions after each significant update to avoid newly introduced vulnerabilities
- Keep track of newly introduced features such as Threads, Scheduled Events, or Stage Channels and configure their
  permissions carefully (e.g., who can start or join a Thread) to prevent abuse by spammers or scammers

---

### Cold Admin Accounts

A Cold Admin account provides enhanced security because it serves exclusively as the server owner and is not used for
everyday activities. If a regular admin account is compromised, attackers gain full access to the server or account,
making it challenging to involve support and potentially requiring days or weeks to resolve the issue. Using a Cold
Admin means creating a separate account dedicated solely to ownership functions, keeping it isolated from routine
operations.

#### What is a Cold Device?

A Cold Device is a factory-reset device with no previous configuration. This should be a dedicated phone or laptop —
you can use an old iPhone/Android, Windows device, or even a Chromebook to keep costs down. Everyone involved in
setup and maintenance must ONLY access the Cold Admin account from a cold device.

#### Cold Admin Setup

##### Step 1: Create a dedicated email account

Create a brand new Gmail account specifically for this Discord account. Do not use a VPN during this process, and
it's best to use an incognito browser. After creating the Gmail account:

- [ ] Set up 2FA immediately (authenticator app recommended, or Security Key for maximum security)
- [ ] Ensure "Skip password when possible" is **off**
- [ ] Do not add a phone number to the account
- [ ] Note down the 10 backup codes **offline on paper** (DO NOT store online)
- [ ] Write down the email, password, and backup codes on paper and store securely

##### Step 2: Create the Discord account

Head to [https://discord.com](https://discord.com) and create a new account using the Gmail account you just created.

- [ ] Write down the email, username, password, and date of birth **offline**
- [ ] Use a username that is not related to your project
- [ ] Give the profile a profile picture in **My Account > Edit User Profile**
- [ ] Go to **Content & Social** and disable DMs from server members and set spam filter to maximum
- [ ] Set the account status to **Invisible** so no one can see if it's online (click profile in bottom left > change status)

##### Step 3: Join the server and transfer ownership

- [ ] Send the Cold Admin account a friend request from your personal Discord account
- [ ] Have the Cold Admin join the Discord server and complete verification like a normal account
- [ ] Assign the Cold Admin the highest admin role
- [ ] Have the Cold Admin send a few messages in a private team chat
- [ ] Wait approximately 24 hours, send a few more messages, then transfer ownership

**To transfer ownership:** Go to **Server Settings > Members** > Search for the Cold Admin account > Click the three
dots > Select **Transfer Ownership** > Input 2FA > Confirm

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Triple-check that you are transferring to the correct Cold Admin account. If you transfer to the
> wrong account, recovery will be extremely difficult.

#### Use of Cold Admin Account

- **Do not** use the Cold Admin account for day-to-day operations
- Log into both the Gmail and Discord account at least once a month (set a phone reminder)
- Use only for: inviting/adding bots, making major changes only the server owner can perform
- If an incident or compromise occurs, log into the Cold Admin to regain control — the server owner always maintains
  full access rights

---

### Backup Systems

- Use a bot like ServerBackup to regularly backup your server configuration
- Store backups securely off-platform

---

### Additional Recommendations

- Set up account leveling for new members for gradually enabling permissions
- Regularly review server audit logs for admin and mod actions
- Use anti-raid bots like Wick or Dyno and configure automatic lock-down settings for suspicious activity
- Regularly review **Server Settings > Integrations** for newly added apps or link shorteners; disable suspicious
  integrations or automate link scanning with a bot that checks URLs against known phishing databases

> **Important:** Discord servers should not be used for any confidential communication (i.e., any admin discussions
> beyond the scope of server moderation) — even restricted channels and DMs are not end-to-end encrypted.

---

### Stay Updated

- Consult the official [Discord Moderator Academy](https://discord.com/moderation) for ongoing best practices and new features
- Implement recommended strategies (e.g., improved spam filters, updated role recommendations)
