# GoDaddy Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for GoDaddy:** Protect your domain registrar account with non-SMS two-factor authentication,
> regularly review delegate access and active sessions, and enable DNSSEC on all domains to prevent DNS spoofing
> and domain hijacking attacks.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal GoDaddy account. All team members and admins should configure these on their own accounts.

### Individual Account Settings

- Account Settings >
  - Login & Pin >
    - [ ]  2-Step Verification > **On** (non-SMS)
    - [ ]  Active sign-ins > **Review and remove any unused or unrecognized**
  - [ ]  Delegate Access > **Review and remove any unused or unrecognized**

---

## For Team Members

These guidelines apply to team members who have delegate access to GoDaddy accounts but don't have full administrative control.

Team members should:

- Ensure their individual account settings are configured according to the checklist above
- Understand the scope of their delegate access permissions
- Report any suspicious domain or DNS activity to account administrators
- Never share login credentials or delegate access with unauthorized parties

---

## For Admins

These settings and practices apply to GoDaddy account administrators who manage domains and DNS settings.

### Domain Security

- [ ]  Domain Settings > DNS > DNSSEC > **On**

### Best Practices

- Regularly audit delegate access and remove any that are no longer needed
- Monitor domain expiration dates and enable auto-renewal for critical domains
- Use domain locking features to prevent unauthorized transfers
- Review DNS records periodically for any unauthorized changes
