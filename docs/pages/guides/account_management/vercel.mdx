# Vercel Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Vercel:** Secure your Vercel account by enabling two-factor authentication, reviewing personal
> access tokens, and ensuring team-level security policies are enforced. Configure deployment protection, mark sensitive
> environment variables appropriately, and regularly audit team member access and integrations.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.
