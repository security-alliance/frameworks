# Sentry Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Sentry:** Secure your Sentry account by enabling two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing
> API tokens and authorized applications, and ensuring organization-wide security policies are enforced. Remove any
> unnecessary integrations and audit team member access to minimize attack surface.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.
