# Slack Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Slack:** Secure your Slack workspace by enforcing two-factor authentication with authenticator
> apps only, requiring admin approval for invitations, regularly reviewing member access levels, and blocking jailbroken
> or rooted devices from accessing the workspace.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.

## For Team Members

These guidelines apply to team members who use the Slack workspace.

Team members should:

- Enable two-factor authentication on their Slack account using an authenticator app
- Be cautious of phishing attempts through direct messages or shared links
- Report any suspicious messages or unrecognized workspace members to administrators
- Avoid accessing the workspace from jailbroken or rooted devices
- Be mindful of what sensitive information is shared in channels
