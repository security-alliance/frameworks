# GitHub Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for GitHub:** Secure your GitHub account with non-SMS two-factor authentication, enable push protection, and regularly review connected apps and sessions. For organizations, enforce signed commits, branch protection rules, and restrict member privileges to minimize supply chain attack risks.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal GitHub account. All team members and admins should configure these on their own accounts.

### Individual Account Settings

- Account Settings:
    - [ ]  Public profile > Contributions & activity > Make profile private and hide activity > **On**
    - [ ]  Password and authentication > Two-factor authentication > Enable and configure any method other than **SMS/Text message**
    - [ ]  Sessions > Review and revoke any unrecognized or unnecessary
    - [ ]  SSH and GPG keys > Review and remove any unnecessary
    - [ ]  Organizations > Review and leave any unnecessary
    - [ ]  Code security > User > Push protection for yourself > **Enabled**
    - [ ]  Applications > Review and remove any unnecessary
    - [ ]  Developer settings >

## For Team Members

These guidelines apply to team members who contribute to repositories but don't have administrative access.

Team members should:
- Ensure their individual account settings are configured according to the checklist above
- Enable GPG signing for commits to meet signed commit requirements
- Be aware of branch protection rules that may require pull request approvals
- Regularly review and rotate personal access tokens
- Report any suspicious repository activity to organization admins

## Notes

### [1] Deploy Keys Warning

Do not use deploy keys, they are possession-based access tokens that are a significant security risk. Use [GitHub Apps](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/overview) instead.

### [2] Enterprise Features

This is only available if you have a GitHub Enterprise plan. If you do not, you can set these same rules at the repo level instead.

### [3] Audit Logs

It is recommended to regularly review audit logs for your organization at Logs > Audit log.
