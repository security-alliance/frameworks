# Notion Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Notion:** Secure your Notion account by enabling 2-step verification with an authenticator app
> (not SMS), disabling support access, and for workspaces, restricting publishing, export, and guest access to
> prevent unauthorized data exposure.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.
