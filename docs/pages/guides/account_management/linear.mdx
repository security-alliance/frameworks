## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Linear:** Secure your Linear account with passkeys, regularly review sessions and connected applications, and for workspaces, disable invite links, restrict approved email domains, and control third-party integrations to protect sensitive project data.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal Linear account. All team members and admins should configure these on their own accounts.

### Individual Account Settings

- Settings >
    - [ ]  Sessions, Personal API keys, & Authorized Applications > **Review and remove any unnecessary or unrecognized**
    - [ ]  Passkeys > Add a passkey (recommended)
    - [ ]  Connected Accounts > **Review and remove any unnecessary or unrecognized**

These guidelines apply to team members who use Linear for project management but don't have administrative access.

Team members should:
- Ensure their individual account settings are configured according to the checklist above
