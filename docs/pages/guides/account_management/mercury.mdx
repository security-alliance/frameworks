## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Mercury:** Secure your Mercury account by enabling two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing active sessions and linked profiles, and for organizations, enabling ACH authorization and dual admin approval to prevent unauthorized transactions.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.
