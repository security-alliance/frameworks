# Telegram Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway:** Stay vigilant with group chats on Telegram. Implement verification steps and secure communication
> practices to protect against sophisticated interception attacks.

While **Telegram** is widely used in the crypto community, it's crucial to understand its security limitations. Telegram
**does not** offer end-to-end encryption (**E2EE**) by default, which means your messages could potentially be accessed
by third parties. Additionally, Telegram's reliance on phone numbers for account creation can expose users to SIM
swapping attacks, and its peer-to-peer call feature can reveal your IP address to other users. If **E2EE** is a
priority, consider using [Signal](https://signal.org/).

However, if you choose to use **Telegram**, the following best practices can help enhance your security.

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal Telegram account. All team members and admins should configure these on
their own accounts.

### Account Security Checklist

- Account Settings:
  - Privacy & Security >
    - Security >
      - [ ]  Two-Step Verification > **On**
        - Telegram does not require a login by default. However, you can set up a password that acts as a "second"
        2FA method when logging in from a new device.
        - Telegram sign-ups require a phone number, but you can also enable two-factor authentication via a
        password—your main protection if you're ever SIM-swapped. **Don't reuse this password anywhere else.**
        - Do not set a password hint, do add a recovery email
        - **SMS Codes:** Telegram sends a code via SMS, which is not secure.
        - **Email Recovery:** Offers email recovery, which is more secure but lacks options for authenticator apps or
        hardware keys.
        - **Backup Password:** If you lose this password, access to your account may be compromised. Write it down
        offline and ensure it is not lost.
      - [ ]  Local passcode > **On** (recommended)
        - This feature adds a passcode to access your Telegram app after a period of inactivity. The default setting is
        "away for 1 hour."
        - **Store Passcode Securely:** Do not lose this passcode—store it offline if needed.
        - **Unique Passcode:** Ensure it is different from your phone's unlock passcode.
      - Active sessions >
        - Telegram supports auto-terminating inactive sessions. You can also manually review and end any suspicious
        active sessions.
        - [ ]  Review and delete all unused sessions
        - [ ]  Terminate old sessions > **1 month**
    - Privacy >
      - Consider adjusting the following settings based on your country, usage, and purpose for using Telegram:
      - [ ]  Phone Number > Who can see my phone number > **Nobody**
        - Making your phone number visible can expose you to unwanted contact or social engineering attacks.
        Restricting visibility helps safeguard your personal info.
      - [ ]  Phone Number > Who can find me by my number > **My Contacts**
      - [ ]  Phone Number > Exceptions > Remove all
      - [ ]  Last Seen & Online > Who can see my timestamp > **Nobody**/**My Contacts**
      - [ ]  Last Seen & Online > Exceptions > Remove all
      - [ ]  Profile Photo > Who can see my profile photo > **Everybody**
        - Set to **Everybody** to stop scammers from impersonating your profile picture.
      - [ ]  Bio > Who can see my bio > **Nobody** (depending on use of Telegram)
      - [ ]  Date of Birth > Who can see my date of birth > **Nobody**
      - [ ]  Date of Birth > Exceptions > Remove all
      - [ ]  Forwarded Messages > Who can add a link to my account when forwarding my messages > **Nobody**
      - [ ]  Calls > Who can call me > **Nobody**/**My Contacts**
      - [ ]  Calls > Exceptions > Remove all
      - [ ]  Calls > Peer-to-peer > Use peer-to-peer with > **Nobody**/**My Contacts**

        > **Note**: Peer-to-peer calls leak your IP address to callers. Set to **Nobody** to preserve anonymity

      - [ ]  Calls > Peer-to-peer > Exceptions > Always allow > Remove all
      - [ ]  Groups & Channels > Who can add me to groups and channels > **Nobody**/**My contacts**
        - This helps prevent being added to random groups that may impersonate legitimate groups and lead to scams.
      - [ ]  Groups & Channels > Exceptions > Remove all
      - [ ]  Voice Messages > Who can send me voice messages > **Nobody**/**My contacts**
      - [ ]  Voice Messages > Exceptions > Remove all
      - [ ]  Messages > Who can send me messages > **My Contacts and Premium Users**
        (or **Everybody**/**My Contacts** depending on use of Telegram)
    - [ ]  New chats from unknown users > Archive and Mute > **Enabled**
    - [ ]  Bots and website > **Clear Payment and Shipping Info**
    - [ ]  Auto-Delete Messages > Set a time frame (e.g., 1 week) based on your risk tolerance
      - Consider the photo you shared with a friend several months ago. While it might have slipped your mind, an
      attacker who gains access to your account could find such information quite valuable.
  - Advanced >
    - [ ]  Automatic media download > Disable all types in all cases

      > **Note**: Automatic media download leaves you exposed to advanced malware attacks

    - Version and updates >
      - Ensure you are always using the latest version of Telegram to benefit from the newest security patches and features.
      - [ ]  Check for Updates: Visit your device's app store regularly
      - [ ]  Update automatically > **Enabled**
      - [ ]  Install beta versions > **Disabled**

> **Authentication Guidelines**: When establishing a secret chat,
> [compare the encryption keys](https://core.telegram.org/techfaq#q-how-are-secret-chats-authenticated)
> outside of telegram, in an established/authenticated channel, outside of telegram. When establishing a
> peer-to-peer (encrypted) call,
> [compare the emojis](https://core.telegram.org/techfaq#q-how-are-voice-and-video-calls-authenticated)
> in an established/authenticated channel, outside of telegram. These are your defenses against man-in-the-middle

### Device-Level Security

Securing the device you use for Telegram is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to your account and messages.

- [ ]  **Enable Full Device Encryption**:
  - Ensure your device has full disk encryption enabled
  - For iOS: This is enabled by default with a passcode
  - For Android: Go to **Settings > Security > Encryption** and follow instructions

- [ ]  **Set Strong Device Passcodes**:
  - Use alphanumeric passwords rather than simple PINs
  - Enable biometric authentication as a secondary measure

- [ ]  **Keep Your Device Updated**:
  - Install OS updates promptly to patch security vulnerabilities
  - Update Telegram to the latest version regularly

- [ ]  **Install Security Software**:
  - Use reputable anti-malware software on your device
  - Consider privacy-focused apps that detect network anomalies

- [ ]  **Secure Your Backups**:
  - Ensure any device backups containing Telegram data are encrypted
  - Be cautious about cloud backups that might store Telegram messages

---

### Advanced Privacy Measures

#### Consider Using a Different Phone Number

Even if you implement all the recommended security measures, there are still valid reasons to use a separate phone
number. For instance, it can help prevent your contacts from discovering your Telegram account or reduce the risk of
accidental number exposure. This is particularly important because the **"Share My Phone Number"** option is enabled by
default whenever you add a new contact.

#### Using a VoIP Number

Telegram restricts many VoIP providers, but services like [Google Voice](https://voice.google.com/) or
[Burner](https://www.burnerapp.com/) might work. Purchase a burner number solely for Telegram if you prefer additional
anonymity.

#### Using an Anonymous Number

In December 2022, Telegram introduced support for anonymous numbers purchased through its [TON](https://ton.org/)
blockchain infrastructure. You can also check out [Fragment](https://fragment.com/) for such options.

#### Use Secret Chats for Enhanced Privacy

For conversations that require an extra layer of security, use Telegram's Secret Chats, which offer **end-to-end
encryption**.

1. **Start a Secret Chat**: Open the chat with the desired contact, tap on their name, and select **Start Secret Chat**
2. **Benefits**:
   - Messages are encrypted and can only be read by you and the recipient
   - Offers self-destruct timers for messages
   - Prevents forwarding of messages to other chats

#### Data Settings

**Go to:** Settings > Privacy and Security > Data Settings

- [ ]  **Sync Contacts:** Disable (depending on use of Telegram) to prevent syncing your contacts.
- [ ]  **Suggest Frequent Contacts:** Disable (depending on use of Telegram) to avoid unsolicited contact suggestions.

---

### Best Practices for Safe Use

- [ ]  **Use Secret Chats:** When messaging someone, create a 'secret' chat to ensure encrypted 1:1 communication,
providing end-to-end encryption for sensitive transactions.
- [ ]  **Verify Group Invites and Authenticity:** Always triple-check group invitations and confirm the legitimacy of
  group chats through separate channels to avoid joining impostor groups that share malicious links.
- [ ]  **Beware of Unsolicited DMs:** Never trust direct messages from anyone sending links or posing as "support",
"exchanges," or "team" members.
- [ ]  **Double-Check Payment Details:** Verify payment information through multiple methods before transferring
funds to prevent fund redirection.
- [ ]  **Block and Report Scammers:** Use the block function to prevent further contact, and report spammers/scammers
instead of just deleting chats.
- [ ]  **Be Cautious with Third-Party Bots and Integrations:**
  - Third-party bots can enhance functionality but may also introduce vulnerabilities.
  - Only add bots from reputable sources
  - Limit the permissions you grant to bots
  - Periodically review and remove unnecessary bots
- [ ]  **Exercise Caution with Mini Apps:** Avoid logging in or
  providing information to mini apps that redirect outside of
  Telegram. Triple-check the username of the mini app to ensure
  its legitimacy, as Telegram lacks a bot verification system.
  Never download or run any commands from Telegram on your device.
- [ ]  **Enhance Privacy with a VPN:** *Advanced tip:* Set up a
  proxy or VPN to hide your IP address while using the Telegram
  app.
- [ ]  **Stay Vigilant Against Scam Ads:** Be aware that anyone can post ads in channels, with 99% being scam ads.
Exercise caution when interacting with advertisements.

### Platform-Specific Risks: Man-in-the-Group Attack

Attackers can exploit Telegram's group chat features to intercept and manipulate communications between two parties.
Here's a concise example of how such an attack might occur:

#### Scenario: Intercepting a Payment Deal

#### Step 1: Initial Communication

- **Alice** and **Bob** decide to finalize a cryptocurrency deal using a Telegram group chat named **"Crypto Deals"**.

#### Step 2: Attackers Create Cloned Groups

- **Attacker 1** creates **Group A** impersonating **Alice**.
- **Attacker 2** creates **Group B** impersonating **Bob**.

#### Step 3: Replicating Conversations

- **In Group A (Impersonating Alice):**
  - The attacker, posing as Alice, relays Alice's messages from Group B to maintain the conversation.

- **In Group B (Impersonating Bob):**
  - The attacker, posing as Bob, mirrors Bob's messages from Group A, acting as a middleman without altering the
    content.

#### Step 4: Swapping Payment Details

- **In Group A:**
  - Fake Alice and Bob agree to the terms of the deal.
  - Bob shares his payment address.

- **In Group B:**
  - Fake Bob shares his swapped payment address.
  - The conversation continues normally, with neither Alice nor Bob aware of the swap.

#### Step 5: Execution of the Scam

- **Alice** sends the payment to what she believes are Bob's details but are actually those of Fake Bob.
- The attacker now controls both ends of the conversation, having successfully redirected the funds.

## For Team Members

These guidelines apply to team members who help manage Telegram groups/channels but don't have full administrative
access.

Team members should:

- Ensure their individual account settings are configured according to the checklist above
- Each admin must follow the guidance for securing their individual accounts
- Add a suffix to your username, for example: "MyName | will never DM you"
- Understand how to verify the authenticity of admins and official messages
- Be aware of the Man-in-the-Group Attack scenario described above

---

## For Admins

These settings and practices apply to Telegram group/channel administrators with elevated privileges.

### Channel & Group Settings Checklist

#### Channel Settings

- Open channel > click channel name > **Channel settings**
  - [ ]  Sign messages > **Enable** (if non-repudiation is desired)
  - [ ]  Administrators > Review the list and remove any unnecessary

#### Group Settings

- Open group > click group name > click three dots >
  **Manage group**

    - [ ]  Exceptions should be restricted to valid use cases
      - Team members should have exceptions granted to them for these rather than them being admins, when possible
  - [ ]  **Invite links** > Review and remove unnecessary
    - Links should be limited by time period or number of users, when not obstructive
  - [ ]  **Administrators** > Review and remove unnecessary & review permissions of each admin
    - Again, it is recommended to add exceptions for team members rather than add them as admins, when possible
    - Remove unnecessary permissions, especially **Add new admins**
    - **Aggressive Anti-Spam** > **Enabled**
  - [ ]  **Members** > Review and remove unnecessary (If a confidential channel)

---

### Admin Permissions Management

If you manage Telegram groups or channels, properly configuring admin permissions is crucial for maintaining security.

- [ ]  **Limit Admin Privileges**:
  - Go to your group/channel, tap the group name, select **Administrators**
  - Only grant necessary permissions to each admin
  - Avoid giving "Add Users" permission to untrusted admins

- [ ]  **Implement Admin Verification**:
  - Establish a verification process before promoting members to admin
  - Use separate channels (like voice calls) to confirm admin identities
  - Document when admin changes occur and why

- [ ]  **Configure Group Settings**:
  - Restrict member actions such as sending media or links
  - Enable "Slow Mode" for large groups to prevent spam
  - Use discussion groups for channels to control information flow

- [ ]  **Audit Admin Activities**:
  - Regularly review admin actions in the group
  - Remove inactive or suspicious admins
  - Consider using admin action logs if available

- [ ]  **Handle Admin Transitions Securely**:
  - Have protocols for transferring ownership if needed
  - Revoke admin rights immediately when team members leave

- [ ]  **Limit Group Permissions:** Restrict who can add members to groups to prevent unauthorized cloning and protect
against raids.

---

### Additional Recommendations

- [ ]  Add a disclaimer in the description and/or as a pinned message to your channel that states that you will not DM
users, and that support will only be offered via the public channel and dedicated support channels
[[2]](#2-security-disclaimers)
- [ ]  Add a suffix to admin usernames, for example: "MyName | will never DM you"
- [ ]  Each admin must follow the guidance for securing their individual accounts

---

### Educate Community Members on Security Practices

If you're managing a community on Telegram, educating your members about security is vital for collective protection.

- [ ]  **Regular Security Announcements**:
  - Schedule periodic reminders about security best practices
  - Pin important security announcements in your group/channel
  - Create dedicated security FAQ channels or posts

- [ ]  **Clear Verification Procedures**:
  - Establish and communicate how official communications will occur
  - Create verification steps for new members to follow
  - Document how to verify the authenticity of admins and official messages

- [ ]  **Threat Awareness Training**:
  - Share examples of common scams targeting your community
  - Post screenshots of phishing attempts (with sensitive info redacted)
  - Explain the "Man-in-the-Group Attack" and how to avoid it

- [ ]  **Incident Reporting Protocol**:
  - Create clear guidelines for reporting suspicious activity
  - Designate security-focused admins to handle reports
  - Acknowledge reports publicly (without specifics) to encourage vigilance

- [ ]  **Security Resources**:
  - Develop simple, accessible security guides for members
  - Share platform-specific security updates when Telegram releases them
  - Create a security checklist for new community members

---

### Notes

#### [1] Member Control

Restricting the ability to add only to admins allows for revocability of invite links to stop raids or to freeze the
channel if needed.

#### [2] Security Disclaimers

Telegram channels and groups should not be used for any confidential communication, as they are not end-to-end
encrypted, except for 1:1 "secret chats" (which should not be commingled with unencrypted chats).

Example disclaimer: "We will NEVER message you directly to offer support or assistance with our product. For support,
please email us at support@\<company\>.com. DO NOT interact with anyone DMing and claiming to be a \<company\> member.
Please report scams to reports@\<company\>.com"
