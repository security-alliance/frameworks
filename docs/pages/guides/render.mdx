# Render Security

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />

## Summary

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway for Render:** Secure your Render account by enabling two-factor authentication, regularly reviewing CLI tokens, API keys, and SSH public keys, and for workspaces, maintaining strict team member access controls and enabling audit logs.

This checklist is adapted from [Auditware's W3OSC](https://github.com/W3OSC/web3-opsec-standard) standards.

## For Individuals

These settings apply to your personal Render account. All team members and admins should configure these on their own accounts.

### Account Security Checklist

- Account Settings >
    - [ ]  Account Security > Two-Factor Authentication > **Enabled**
    - [ ]  CLI Tokens > **Review and remove any unnecessary or unrecognized**
    - [ ]  API Keys > **Review and remove any unnecessary or unrecognized**
    - [ ]  SSH Public Keys > **Review and remove any unnecessary or unrecognized**

## For Team Members

These guidelines apply to team members who have access to shared Render workspaces but don't have full administrative access.

Team members should:
- Ensure their individual account settings are configured according to the checklist above
- Use the principle of least privilege when accessing workspace resources
- Report any suspicious deployments or unauthorized changes to workspace admins

---

## For Admins

These settings and practices apply to Render workspace administrators with elevated privileges.

### Workspace Settings

- Workspace Settings >
    - [ ]  Team Members > **Review and remove any unnecessary or unrecognized**
    - [ ]  Audit Logs > It is highly recommended that you sign up for an **Organization or Enterprise** plan in order to enable this
