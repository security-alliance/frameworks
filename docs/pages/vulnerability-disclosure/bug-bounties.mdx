# Bug Bounties

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Bug bounty programs incentivize security researchers to identify and report vulnerabilities in your project. They
augments a security team and audits by allowing external security researchers to disclose vulnerabilities in your
project in a way that should be a good experience for the security researcher. Depending what the scope of the bug
bounty program is, you may have a higher success rate having certain parts at different types of bug bounty as a service
providers, as they generally have security researchers with different skill sets using their platforms.
