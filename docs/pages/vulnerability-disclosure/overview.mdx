# Vulnerability Disclosure

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Vulnerability disclosure is the task that is done after a vulnerability has been identified and fixed, and means to make
the vulnerability known to the larger public. Often, a vulnerability disclosure will come after a
[bug bounty](/vulnerability-disclosure/bug-bounties) report has been filed and the vulnerability has been corrected,
or from a team member that noticed a vulnerability which was then fixed. In the event that responsible disclosure of
the vulnerability is not possible because the vulnerable code is actively or will imminently be exploited,
[Safe Harbor](/safe-harbor/overview) may be applicable.
