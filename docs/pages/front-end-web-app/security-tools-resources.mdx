# Security Tools and Resources

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />

There is a very large amount of security tools and resources available, and sometimes it can feel overwhelming.

There is a wide range of security tools to test your web & mobile applications, such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite to scan
your application for vulnerabilities, Snyk to check your dependencies, or MobSF for security analysis on Android/iOS
applications.

For web3, there is also a wide range of tools. Rather than listing specific tools, we are providing links to
repositories listing many of these tools:
