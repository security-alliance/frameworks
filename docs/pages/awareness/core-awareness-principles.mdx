# 1. Core Awareness Principles

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> 🔑 **Key Takeaway**: Security awareness is built on fundamental principles like threat recognition, risk assessment,
> and zero trust verification. These principles form the foundation of a security-conscious culture where every
> individual plays a vital role in protecting organizational assets.

## Key concepts

- **Threat Recognition**:

Understand that threats come in various forms—phishing, social engineering, malware, and insider risks. For instance, a
social media message urging immediate action might be a scam designed to exploit urgency.

- **Risk Perception**:

Assessing risk means evaluating both the likelihood of an attack and the potential impact. For example, if you
frequently receive messages from unknown sources on a platform like Twitter, you should view these interactions with
increased skepticism.

- **Zero Trust Mindset**:

Always verify before trusting. Even messages from familiar contacts should be confirmed if they involve unexpected
requests or sensitive information.

- **Filtering Credible Information**:

In an era of information overload, it's critical to identify and rely on reputable sources. This means following
established security blogs, official alerts from cybersecurity agencies, or verified community channels.

- **Organizational Responsibility**:

Security is a shared responsibility that requires commitment at all levels of the organization. Leadership must
demonstrate strong commitment by prioritizing and investing in security initiatives, while every team member should
understand their role in maintaining security.

> **Real-World Example**: A company might receive a seemingly routine email from a "vendor" requesting updated banking
> details. An employee with a strong zero trust mindset will independently verify the request through known contact
> numbers or an established internal process, thereby avoiding a potential fraud.
