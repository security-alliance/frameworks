<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

> **Key Takeaway**
Stay vigilant, your awareness is your strongest defense against cyber threats. Recognizing red flags and questioning unexpected requests can prevent costly breaches.

This framework is all about understanding the threat landscape, recognizing risk signals, and cultivating a security-aware mindset. It serves as a high-level guide to help individuals and organizations identify potential vulnerabilities and remain vigilantâ€”without overlapping with the detailed, technical scenarios covered in other sections.

## Introduction & Objectives

The modern digital landscape is filled with sophisticated attacks, including web3-specific threats like crypto drainers and rug pulls. This section lays the foundation for why a high level of security awareness is essential. It's about empowering you to notice, question, and respond appropriately when something feels off. Trust, but verify!

### Objectives

- Recognize Threats: Understand common tactics used by cybercriminals, including both traditional and web3-specific attack vectors.
- Adopt a Proactive Stance: Learn how early recognition can stop an attack in its tracks.
- Foster a Security Culture: Build an organizational environment where security is everyone's responsibility.
- Implement Effective Training: Develop structured approaches to security education for all team members.
- Separate Awareness from Implementation: Focus here on "being aware" rather than the step-by-step controls, which are covered in other sections.
