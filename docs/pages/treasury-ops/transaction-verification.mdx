# Guide: Large Cryptocurrency Transfers

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

## Core Principles

Large cryptocurrency transfers require rigorous verification because transactions are irreversible. This guide covers both receiving and sending significant amounts, with security measures scaling to transfer size.

---

## Part 1: Receiving Large Transfers

### Pre-Transfer Setup (48 Hours Before)

#### Generate Fresh Deposit Address

Always create a new address for large incoming transfers. Never reuse addresses from previous large transfers.

**Why use fresh addresses?** Prevents counterparties from viewing your entire treasury balance/history and isolates each major transfer for clean audit trails.

**For Institutional Custody** (Coinbase, Anchorage, BitGo):
- **Verify you're on the correct website** - check URL carefully, bookmark the official site, watch for phishing lookalikes
- Use the platform's "offline deposit address" or "new address" function
- Enable all available 2FA/MFA when generating addresses

**For Self-Custody**:
- Use hardware wallet with verified firmware
- Document derivation path: `m/44'/60'/0'/0/x` (Ethereum) or `m/84'/0'/0'/0/x` (Bitcoin)

**For higher security (>$5M transfers)**: Generate addresses in air-gapped environment - hardware wallet never connected to internet during address generation.

#### Address Verification Protocol

Have 2-3 team members independently verify the address:

```
1. Generate address in custody platform
2. Person A: Verify via custody UI
3. Person B: Verify via hardware wallet screen (if applicable)
4. Person C: Cross-check via block explorer after first test transaction
5. Perform checksum validation:
   - Ethereum: EIP-55 checksum
   - Bitcoin: Bech32 checksum
```

**For transfers >$1M**: Require all verifiers to sign a document confirming they verified the address character-by-character.

#### Bidirectional Test Transaction

This should occur **24-48 hours before the main transfer**.

**Phase 1: Sender → You (Incoming Test)**
```
1. Sender sends small amount (0.001 ETH or 0.0001 BTC) to your new address
2. Verify receipt through multiple sources:
   - Custody platform interface
   - Primary block explorer (Etherscan, Blockchain.com)
   - Secondary block explorer (redundancy check)
3. Document transaction hash and confirmation time
```

**Phase 2: You → Sender (Outgoing Test)**
```
4. Send test amount BACK to sender's address
5. Sender confirms they received the return
6. Sender provides return transaction hash
7. You verify the hash matches your outbound transaction
```

**Why bidirectional?** Proves address can both receive AND withdraw funds before large transfer arrives, and confirms both parties control their stated addresses.

**For transfers >$1M**: Require sender to sign a message with their sending address proving cryptographic control, not just ability to send from it.

#### Coordinate with Sender

Provide via encrypted channel (PGP email or Signal):
- Deposit address
- Network specification (Ethereum mainnet chain ID 1, Bitcoin mainnet)
- Test transaction hash (incoming only)
- Video call scheduled time for live transfer

Request from sender:
- Source wallet addresses they'll send from (for immediate detection when transaction broadcasts)
- Approximate transfer timing: specific date and time window
  - Example: "Tuesday, March 15th, 2:00-6:00 PM EST"
  - This allows you to have all required personnel available and monitoring
- Whether they'll use single or multiple transactions

**Best practices for transaction splitting:**
- **<$10M**: Single transaction preferred (simpler, one confirmation cycle, cleaner records)
- **>$10M**: Consider 2-3 separate transactions (reduces single-transaction risk, allows staged confirmation, provides pause points to verify each step)
- **>$50M**: Multiple transactions strongly recommended with 30-minute intervals between each

**For transfers >$5M - Anti-Social-Engineering Protocols:**

Establish code phrase during initial verified meeting. Use this phrase to authenticate any address changes or unusual requests. Example: "What was the name of the restaurant where we finalized the agreement?" Exchange secondary contact numbers for key personnel - if primary contact requests changes, call secondary to confirm. Maintain out-of-band verification: if request comes via email, confirm via phone.

**Red flags that should trigger immediate verification:**
- Urgent requests to bypass procedures or claims of "emergency"
- Requests to send to "temporary" or "new" address without proper verification
- Pressure to skip test transactions or any rushed requests

If anything feels wrong, STOP and verify through multiple channels. Urgency is an attacker's favorite tool - legitimate counterparties will understand security delays.

### Day of Transfer

#### Pre-Transfer Video Verification (30 minutes prior to transfer)

Require video call with minimum 2 internal people present.

**Liveness and identity verification** (prevents AI deepfakes):
```
1. Ask participant to hold up specific number of fingers (change unpredictably)
2. Ask them to wave their hand in front of their face
3. Request they state current date and time
4. Reference specific details from previous conversations only real participant would know
5. If anything seems off, halt the transfer and investigate
```

**Critical confirmations during call:**

1. **Address Reconfirmation**
   - Read deposit address character-by-character from your screen
   - Sender confirms they see identical address on their screen
   - **Critical: "Read ONLY from your custody platform or hardware wallet screen"**
   - **Do NOT copy from email, Etherscan, any block explorer, or any intermediary source**
   - **Only trust the address shown directly in your custody interface or on your hardware wallet device**
   - This prevents compromised email or man-in-the-middle attacks from causing misdirection

2. **Test Transaction Review**
   - Display both test transactions on block explorer during call
   - Confirm sender sees same transaction hashes
   - Verify sender's address matches test transaction sender address
   - Review the bidirectional test from 24-48 hours ago

3. **Amount and Network**
   - State total amount in native units and USD equivalent
   - Confirm network explicitly: "Ethereum mainnet, chain ID 1" (not testnet, not L2)
   - If ERC-20 tokens: State token name AND read out full contract address
     - Example: "Sending 100,000 USDC, contract address 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48"
     - Verify contract address against official source (token website, CoinGecko) on call
   - Confirm no mistakes in decimal places or token contract

#### Live Monitoring

**Understanding Blockchain Finality:**

Wait for enough confirmations that a chain reorganization becomes economically infeasible or cryptographically impossible.

**Monitoring phases:**
```
1. Transaction Broadcast: Appears in mempool, verify correct parameters
2. First Confirmation: Included in a block
3. Progressive Confirmations: Each block makes reversal exponentially harder
4. Finality: Sufficient confirmations reached, transaction irreversible
```

**Confirmation requirements by chain:**

- **Ethereum**: 12 confirmations (~3 minutes) | 32+ for >$10M transfers
- **Bitcoin**: 6 confirmations (~60 minutes) | 3 acceptable for <$100K
- **Polygon**: 128 confirmations (~5 minutes)
- **BSC**: 15 confirmations (~45 seconds)
- **Avalanche**: 1 confirmation (~2 seconds)
- **Solana**: 32 slots (~15 seconds)

**For transfers >$10M**: Wait for double the standard confirmation count.

**On-call updates from Technical Operator:**
- "Transaction in mempool, parameters correct"
- "Block 1 confirmed, no anomalies"
- "Block 12 confirmed, [X.XXX] ETH received and final"

#### Dual Confirmation Requirement

Before ending call, verify through TWO sources:
1. Custody platform showing updated balance
2. Block explorer showing confirmed transaction

**For transfers >$10M**: Add third verification via direct node query or alternative explorer.

#### Post-Receipt Actions

**Immediate (within 15 min):**
- Document transaction hash, block number, timestamp
- Record amount in native units and USD equivalent
- Note all personnel involved

**Within 30 minutes:**
- Email confirmation to sender with transaction details
- Update internal treasury ledger

## Part 2: Sending Large Cryptocurrency Transfers

### Pre-Transfer Planning (72 Hours Before)

#### Authorization

Document and obtain approvals:
- Purpose of transfer
- Recipient verification
- Amount and timeline
- Required signatures based on amount:
  - <$100K: Treasury Manager
  - $100K-$1M: CFO + Security Officer
  - >$1M: CFO + CEO (or governance vote for DAOs)

**For transfers >$10M**: Board resolution or full governance vote with documented quorum.

#### Recipient Address Verification

Multi-source verification is critical:

```
STEP 1: Receive address through official channel
├─> Request via verified email/signed contract
├─> Request recipient sign message proving address control

STEP 2: Independent verification by 3 people
├─> Person A: Gets address from recipient's website
├─> Person B: Gets address from direct recipient communication
├─> Person C: Verifies via blockchain history (if known entity)
└─> All three MUST match exactly

STEP 3: Mandatory test transaction
├─> Send $10-100 equivalent first
├─> Wait for recipient confirmation
├─> Recipient provides test transaction hash
├─> Verify hash matches your outbound transaction
└─> Proves recipient controls address and communications secure
```

**Never skip the test transaction.** This single step prevents the majority of costly errors.

#### Whitelist Addition (If Using Custody Platform)

Most institutional custody platforms support whitelisting:

```
1. Submit whitelist request with justification
2. Wait mandatory cooling-off period:
   - Standard: 24-48 hours
   - High security: 72 hours
   - >$10M transfers: 1 week
3. Different team member approves whitelist addition
4. Test transaction AFTER whitelist approval
5. Then proceed with large transfer
```

**Why cooling-off periods?** Prevents attackers who gain account access from immediately adding malicious addresses and draining funds. Gives time for legitimate personnel to notice unauthorized changes.

### Day of Transfer

#### Final Verification Checklist (15 min before)

Minimum 2 people present, verify:

```
□ Authorization documentation signed
□ Recipient address verified by 3 independent sources
□ Test transaction confirmed successful by recipient
□ Whitelist cooling-off period complete (if applicable)
□ Exact amount confirmed (recipient expects this amount)
□ Network confirmed (mainnet, not testnet)
□ Sufficient balance in source wallet (amount + fees + buffer)
□ All required approvers available next 60 minutes
```

**For transfers >$1M**: Conduct formal video call with all approvers present.

#### Execution Protocol

**Video Call Requirements** (for large transfers):

```
1. Screen share custody interface or wallet
2. Primary operator reads transaction parameters aloud:
   - "Sending [X.XXXXX] ETH"
   - "To address: 0x[read full address character-by-character]"
   - "On network: Ethereum mainnet, chain ID 1"
   
3. Each approver independently verifies on their device:
   - Destination matches authorized recipient
   - Amount matches approved transfer
   - Network is correct (not testnet)
   
4. Approvers use MFA to approve:
   - Hardware security key, biometric, or authenticator app
   - For hardware wallets: verify address on device screen
   - Verbally confirm: "I approve this transaction"

5. Final approval triggers broadcast to blockchain
```

**Critical verification moment**: After broadcast, immediately verify transaction hash shown in custody platform matches what appears in block explorer. This detects any tampering between approval and broadcast.

#### Post-Submission Monitoring

Monitor transaction through finality:

```
1. Copy transaction hash from custody platform
2. Enter into block explorer immediately
3. Verify parameters match intended transaction
4. Monitor confirmation progress:
   - Ethereum: Wait for 12 confirmations (~3 minutes)
   - Bitcoin: Wait for 6 confirmations (~60 minutes)
   - For >$10M: Wait for double the standard confirmations
5. Watch for recipient confirmation of receipt
```

#### Confirmation and Documentation

After transaction reaches finality:

```
1. Internal record (within 15 min):
   - Transaction hash and block number
   - Timestamp and confirmation count
   - Source wallet balance updated in records

2. Request receipt from recipient (within 30 min):
   - Formal acknowledgment they received funds
   - For >$1M: Signed receipt document

3. Permanent documentation:
   - Full transaction details (hash, block, timestamp, amount)
   - Authorization chain (who approved, when)
   - Personnel involved
   - Total cost (amount + fees)
   - USD equivalent at execution time
```

## Multi-Signature Best Practices

### Signer Security

Each signer maintains:
- Dedicated hardware wallet for treasury operations
- Verified and updated firmware
- Secure physical storage when not in use
- Backup seed phrase in separate geographic location
- No delegation of signing authority

**For >$5M treasuries**: Geographically distribute signers across time zones and jurisdictions.

### Threshold Configurations

Scale security with asset value:

```
$100K-$1M:    2-of-3 multi-sig
$1M-$10M:     3-of-5 multi-sig
$10M-$50M:    4-of-6 multi-sig
>$50M:        5-of-7 or higher
```

### Signing Ceremony (>$10M transfers)

Formal process for largest transfers:

```
1. Schedule 48 hours in advance
2. Each signer receives transaction details packet
3. Independent verification by each signer
4. Video conference with all signers
5. Screen share showing parameters
6. Each signer reads parameters aloud
7. Sequential signing with narration
8. Final signer confirms broadcast
9. All verify transaction in explorer
10. Session recorded and documented
```

## Critical Risk Mitigations

### Address Verification

**Hardware wallet display verification:**
- Always check address on hardware wallet screen
- Never trust computer display alone
- Verify entire address character-by-character

**Address poisoning defense:**
- Never copy from transaction history
- Always copy from authoritative source
- Use custody platform address books when available

### Communication Security

**Email compromise prevention:**
- Address confirmation during video call prevents MITM
- Live verbal verification catches discrepancies
- Code phrases for authentication

**Social engineering defense:**
- Never accept urgent bypass requests
- Callback on known numbers to verify
- Any request to skip verification triggers security review

### Multi-Party Controls

**Prevents single-actor fraud:**
- Multiple personnel for large transfers
- Video recording of approvals (with consent)
- Separation of duties: requester ≠ approver ≠ technical executor

### Transaction Parameter Security

**Custody platform policy engines:**
- Enforce withdrawal limits automatically
- Block transactions to non-whitelisted addresses
- Require elevated approvals above thresholds
- Create circuit breakers if account compromised

## Key Principles Summary

1. **Test everything**: Small test transactions can catch human errors
2. **Verify independently**: Multiple people through different channels
3. **Never rush**: Urgency benefits attackers, not you
4. **Hardware wallet verification**: Trust the device screen, not the computer
5. **Verify addresses**: Verify addresses during video calls
6. **Defense in depth**: One failure shouldn't cause catastrophic loss

**In cryptocurrency, there are no chargebacks.** Every transaction is final. The procedures in this guide may seem extensive, but preventing a single mistake justifies significant operational overhead.

The cost of verification is measured in minutes. The cost of a mistake is measured in millions.
