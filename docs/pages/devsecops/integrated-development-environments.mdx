# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

<TagList tags={frontmatter.tags} />
<AttributionList contributors={frontmatter.contributors} />

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) are essential tools for developers, but they also need to be secured.
Consider implementing the following best practices:

1. Ensure IDEs are configured securely, with plugins and extensions only installed from trusted sources. Some IDEs have
  features that allow for automated execution of files in folders. Use restricted mode if you don't fully trust a project.
2. Keep IDEs and their plugins/extensions up-to-date to protect against vulnerabilities.
3. Integrate static code analysis tools within the IDE to catch security issues early in the development process.
4. Configure IDEs to follow the principle of least privilege, limiting access to sensitive information and systems.
5. Ensure that potential development environments are isolated from production environments.
