- [Discord Security](/community-management/discord): ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway for Discord:** To secure your Discord server, focus on implementing robust access controls and enforcing two-factor authentication for all administrators. Regularly audit roles and permissions, and maintain vigilant moderation. Educate your community about security best practices to prevent unauthorized access and protect against potential threats.
- [Community Management](/community-management/overview): Communities might be the key of many Web3 projects, but they also represent a significant security challenge. From casual users to top-level executives, everyone within an organization can be targeted by social engineering tactics across platforms like Telegram, Discord, X (formerly Twitter), Google, and more. When a community channel is compromisedâ€”whether by phishing, fraudulent links, or account takeoversâ€”it can quickly become a vehicle for wider attacks, putting both users and organizational reputations at risk.
- [Twitter Security](/community-management/twitter): ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaway for Twitter (X):** To secure your Twitter account, prioritize using an authenticator app or security key over SMS-based 2FA, remove your phone number, and regularly review third-party app permissions. Ensure your recovery settings are robust and frequently monitor account activity to safeguard your online presence and maintain community trust.
